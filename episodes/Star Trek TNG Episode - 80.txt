	Another Romulan guard approaches, weapon at the
	ready... But before he can fire again...

52   RIKER (OPTICAL)

	fires, knocking the guard off his feet.

53   INT. ANOTHER TUNNEL

	Riker and Ethan round a corner and come face to face
	with a surprised Romulan guard. The Romulan goes for
	his weapon. Too late. Riker fires first. As the
	guard falls, Riker and Ethan run toward...

53A  ANGLE ON AIR CONDITIONING GRATE

	The boy stops by the floor level air conditioning
	grate, swings it open, and motions.

					ETHAN
			In here...

	Riker follows him as Ethan climbs inside, then pulls
	the grate shut behind them.

54   OMITTED

55   INT. A NARROW CRAWLSPACE

	Almost pitch black. The only light comes through the
	slots in that grate. Ethan hurriedly slides bolts into
	place, securing the grate as echoing footsteps approach
	in the tunnel beyond...

	... Riker and Ethan freeze against the walls on either
	side of the grate as the feet and legs of the Romulan
	guards appear in the tunnel outside.

	One of the Romulans kneels down, peers through the
	grate... then suddenly seizes it with his hand and
	gives it a hard shake as we...

56   OMITTED

									FADE OUT.

61   INT. CRAWLSPACE - CONTINUOUS

	Riker's hand tightens on that captured phaser as the
	guard gives the grate a last shake... then steps away
	to rejoin his companion...

61A  RIKER'S POV - THROUGH GRATE

	The guards move off down the corridor... paying close
	attention to the sensing device one of them holds.

62   OMITTED

63   INT. CRAWLSPACE

	Riker reacts, puzzled, to the fading footsteps of the
	Romulans in the tunnel. He turns to Ethan and
	whispers.

					RIKER
			Their sensors should have picked
			us up...

	Ethan picks up a lantern from the top of a nearby
	crate, activates it, and plays its beam across the
	rock. As they move a short way down the crawlspace
	to a jumble of oddly shaped crates and freight
	containers...

					ETHAN
			They can't... I heard them say
			there's something in these
			rocks...

					RIKER
			Heavy metals?

					ETHAN
				(nodding)
			Right...

	Ethan starts shoving a large crate aside to reveal
	a dark entryway. Riker moves to help him.

       STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/27/90 - ACT FIVE      48.

63   CONTINUED:

	Then Ethan lights their way with the lantern as Riker
	follows him through the entryway into...

63AA	INT. CRAWLSPACE - ANOTHER SECTION

	Riker and Ethan move through the narrow crawlspace.

					RIKER
			When you escaped last time...
			how'd you manage it?

					ETHAN
			I acted like I was sick... when
			the Romulans took me to the
			infirmary, I ran away.

	Ethan pauses, faces Riker.

					ETHAN
			I was lucky... I found this place
			the same day.

	Riker nods appreciateively as they move on to...

63A  INT. SECRET ROOM

	... Where Ethan activates a light cell, bathing the room
	in a soft glow.

					ETHAN
			... The Romulans forgot all about
			this storeroom when they rebuilt
			the tunnels.

	The boy crosses to a pile of crates stacked in a corner
	of the cluttered room... starts searching through them.

					ETHAN
			After I got away last time...

	Ethan produces a folded piece of synthetic cloth.

					ETHAN
				(continuing)
			... I mapped out all their tunnels.

	He lays the cloth out across a crate... to reveal a
	rough map of the base. As Ethan points things out...

       STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/27/90 - ACT FIVE     48A.

63A  CONTINUED:

					ETHAN
			Supply depot, communications,
			living quarters... and the shuttle
			bay.

					RIKER
				(instantly intrigued)
			How many guards at the shuttle
			bay?

					ETHAN
			Only two or three.

	Riker thinks about it, shakes his head.

					RIKER
			Stealing a shuttle would get us
			nowhere... too easy for the
			Romulans to track one of their
			own ships.
					(MORE)

       STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE      49.

63A  CONTINUED:

					RIKER (Cont'd)
				(points at map)
			But we could break into
			communications. Send a message
			to the Enterprise.

	Ethan looks doubtful. Shakes his head.

					ETHAN
			We can't do that... The
			transmitter is on a
			voice-activated security system!

					RIKER
			Do you know whose voice it
			accepts?

					ETHAN
			Only Ambassador Tomalak.

					RIKER
				(reacts)
			Who?

					ETHAN
			Tomalak.

					RIKER
			Ambassador Tomalak.

	Ethan looks up at him, suddenly aware of the man's
	stunned reaction. Riker just stares at him.

					RIKER
			Tomalak is a Romulan Captain.
			The only time he was called
			"Ambassador" was in their Holodeck
			fantasy. How would you know about
			that?

					ETHAN
			You... you told me about it.

	Riker shakes his head, no I didn't.

					RIKER
			Who are you? What's your part
			in all this?

       STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE      50.

63A  CONTINUED: (2)

	They react to a sudden, off screen explosion and the
	sounds of the approaching Romulans. Ethan turns to
	Riker, shouts a warning...

					ETHAN
			They've found us!

					RIKER
				(calm)
			But you said their sensors didn't
			work in this tunnel.

					ETHAN
			They must have fixed them. We've
			got to go!

	He grabs at Riker, but he won't budge.

					RIKER
			And where will we go, Ethan?

					ETHAN
			To the shuttle bay! There's still
			time.

					RIKER
			No... I've had enough.

	And they both react as...

63B  TOMALAK AND TWO GUARDS

	Step into the room.

					TOMALAK
			Commander... surrender your
			weapon...

	And as the three Romulans raise their weapons... Riker
	drops his phaser and casually lifts his arms, palms
	up.

					RIKER
			No more games. No more fantasies.
			I'm not going to play anymore.

	Then Riker makes eye contact with Ethan. A last, sad
	moment between them. And the boy relaxes... he knows
	the game has finally and truly ended. Then...

66   THE ROMULANS (OPTICAL)

	Suddenly SHIMMER away.

67   THE ENTIRE ROOM (OPTICAL)

	Also disappears... to reveal the immense cavern where
	our story began. Riker and Ethan are left alone in the
	huge room. Riker stares at the boy. Shocked.

					RIKER
			It was never the Romulans... it
			was you all along, wasn't it?

	Ethan hangs his head. Then we go to...

68   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE REAL ENTERPRISE

	Picard and Data are at an aft station, huddled over a
	monitor.

					DATA
			There is no question about it,
			sir. It is his signal.

	Picard acknowledges this with a nod. Then Troi, Worf,
	and Geordi watch, concerned, as...

					PICARD
				(to com)
			Picard to Riker... can you read
			me?

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
				(after a beat)
			Riker to Picard. I'm here.

	The general relief at the sound of Riker's voice is
	obvious.

69   INT. ALIEN CHAMBER

	Riker and Ethan.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Are you all right?

       STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE      52.

69   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Yes... What about Worf and
			Geordi?

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			We beamed them up an hour ago...
			They're fine.

69A  INT. MAIN BRIDGE

					PICARD
			But we lost you in mid-transport.
			Where have you been? What is
			going on down there?

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			I'm not sure, sir.

	Picard raises an eyebrow as we go back to...

69B  INT. ALIEN CHAMBER (OPTICAL)

	Riker and Ethan.

					RIKER
			But I think I'm about to find
			out... stand by.

	Riker keys his insignia and faces the boy, who is sad
	but calm.

					RIKER
			What should I call you? Ethan...
			Jean-Luc?

					ETHAN
				(sad)
			It doesn't matter.

	Riker crosses to the wall, listens to a faint humming
	beyond.

					RIKER
			This room... it's more than just
			a Holodeck, isn't it?


       STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE      53.

69B  CONTINUED:

					ETHAN
				(almost proud)
			Much more. The neural scanners
			read my mind... give me anything
			I want. Just like they tried
			to give you everything you
			wanted.

	Riker is furious... and for good reason.

					RIKER
			What I wanted? You probed the
			Enterprise... lured us here...
			so you could play games with me.
			I didn't want any of that... you
			did. Why?

	The boy looks older, sadder, less the child.

					ETHAN
			My world was invaded... my
			people... killed. My mother
			brought me here... so our enemies
			would never find me.

	Riker reacts... tone changing.

					RIKER
			But they found her, didn't they?

	Ethan nods -- the memory, distant as it is, still
	painful.

					ETHAN
			She knew they would never stop
			looking for her... So she made
			sure I would be safe...

	He touches his forehead, then gestures at the
	surrounding walls as...

69C  ANGLE - INCLUDING CAVERN WALLS (OPTICAL)

	Brief SHIMMERS here and there as the various components
	of Ethan's scanners "uncloak" and reveal themselves.

					ETHAN
			She left the scanners to protect
			me... and to give me everything
			I wanted.

       STAR TREK: "Future Imperfect" - REV. 9/18/90 - ACT FIVE      54.

69C  CONTINUED:

	Riker reacts to the youngster's pain. Abandoned by his
	own father, he knows what it's like to be a lonely
	little boy.

					RIKER
			Everything... then why kidnap me?

					ETHAN
				(after a pause)
			I wanted you to stay. It's been
			so long... I just wanted
			somebody... real. I... thought
			you would be happy... I'm
			sorry...

	Riker is gentle... but insistent.

					RIKER
			I have to return to my ship.
				(a beat)
			Come with me. You don't have
			to stay here anymore... you don't
			have to be alone anymore...

	The boy hesitates. A long beat as he considers.
	Then...

70   ANGLE - FAVORING ETHAN - (OPTICAL)

	The figure of the boy SHIMMERS... and for the first
	time, we see him in his true, alien form.

					THE ALIEN
			My real name is Barash.

	Riker smiles, holds out his hand, and says...

					RIKER
			To me, you'll always be Jean-Luc.

	The alien takes Riker's hand. A silent and special
	moment between them... then Riker keys his insignia.

					RIKER
			Two to transport...

	And as they DEMATERIALIZE, go to...
