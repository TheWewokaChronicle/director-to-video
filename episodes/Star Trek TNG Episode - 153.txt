	FADE IN:

1    INT. A BAR

	It's a rough, wretched watering-hole, just the kind of
	place you'd expect on a frontier world at the edge of
	Federation space. The patrons are a hard and nasty
	bunch -- if you're looking for trouble, this is a good
	place to find it.

2    TROI

	is at the counter, speaking with the BARTENDER, a
	large, intimidating male alien. Deanna is not in
	uniform and instead is wearing clothes that look
	perfectly normal in this place.

	There's a teasing, insouciant quality to Troi -- the
	bartender is attracted to her and she knows it; she's
	using it.

					BARTENDER
			Tell me... why is it so important
			that you find this man?

	Troi smiles, hinting at mystery.

					TROI
			We had some business dealings...
			he owes me money.

					BARTENDER
				(suggestively)
			If we had business dealings, I can
			tell you I wouldn't disappear...

					TROI
			Maybe we should discuss that
			possibility. But first, I have to
			find him... collect the money I'm
			owed...

					BARTENDER
			Let me guess... you and your
			friend were smuggling relics from
			the ruins of Nafir...

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/27/93 - TEASER       2.

2    CONTINUED:

					TROI
				(maybe)
			Mmmmmm...

					BARTENDER
			A dangerous game.

					TROI
			Maybe I like danger.

	He eyes her for a moment, hoping that's an invitation.

					BARTENDER
			Then you've come to the right
			place.
				(leans toward her)
			I'll be closing in a few hours.
			Perhaps we can discuss this...
			more privately.

	Troi would rather have a tooth drilled, but she smiles
	sweetly at him.

					TROI
			If I can't find him, I'll have to
			move on. Are you sure you haven't
			seen him?

					BARTENDER
			Human... two meters tall... smooth-headed...
			no, I don't remember
			anyone like that.

	Troi eyes him.

					TROI
			You're lying...

					BARTENDER
			And you're Betazoid... I thought
			so.

	He leans in to her, speaks quietly.

					BARTENDER
			The people who come here count on
			a certain amount of... anonymity.
			If I started answering questions
			about them... even to a very
			beautiful woman... I wouldn't be
			in business very long.

	He sets another drink in front of her.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       3.

2    CONTINUED: (2)

					BARTENDER
			As a businesswoman, I'm sure you
			understand.

	And he moves off, leaving a frustrated Troi.

3    RIKER

	is in another part of the room. He is with a group of
	people who are in a raucous, merry mood. He laughs
	heartily with them, presumably at a tale that has just
	been told, claps one of them on the back, and
	withdraws.

					RIKER
			Great story... I'll have to
			remember that the next time I'm in
			a knife fight...

	He turns to encounter WORF, and the two move aside and
	talk quietly.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Any luck?

					WORF
			I think the one over there knows
			something.

	Worf looks casually toward a table in the background,
	and Riker's gaze follows.

4    YRANAC - THEIR POV

	A sleazy male Yridian sits alone at a table, sipping a
	drink and watching the scene around him furtively.

5    BACK TO SCENE

					WORF
			He wouldn't admit to having seen
			the Captain... but he said that
			anyone who visited the ruins of
			Nafir would probably come here
			eventually... I suspect he knows
			more.

					RIKER
			Let's go.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       4.

5    CONTINUED:

	Riker moves immediately toward the table; Worf tries to
	tell him something.

					WORF
				(loud whisper)
			Commander -- I told him --

	But Riker is out of earshot. Worf follows him to the
	table where Yranac is sitting. The man looks up a bit
	nervously as they approach and sit with him.

					RIKER
			My friend here tells me you might
			know about the man we're looking
			for.

	Yranac's eyes dart around the room, as though checking
	to see if he's being observed.

					YRANAC
			The only reason I'm talking to
			you... is that I have a sister,
			too.

	Riker glances at Worf, puzzled.

					WORF
				(covering for Riker)
			I explained to him... that we are
			looking for the man who
			impregnated your sister.

	There is a brief beat as Riker looks at Worf, stifling
	his response (is that the best story you could come up
	with?); then he turns back to Yranac.

					RIKER
			You can imagine how much this
			means to me.

					YRANAC
			Family honor is important... If
			someone had defiled my sister...
			I would do anything... pay
			anything... to find the one
			responsible.

	Yranac's message is clear: he's selling this
	information.

					RIKER
			I see. And just how much would
			"anything" be?

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       5.

5    CONTINUED: (2)

					YRANAC
			As much as... five bars of goldpress
			latinum.

	But before Riker can respond, a hand snakes around
	Yranac's neck, pulling him up and off the chair.

					BARTENDER
			I think you've had too much to
			drink. You'd better leave.

	The patrons in the immediate vicinity glance at the
	incident, and move away slightly. They're used to
	these unpleasantries and don't want to get involved.

					BARTENDER
			On your way, Yranac.

	Suddenly a phaser comes into frame and presses against
	the bartender's head.

					BEVERLY'S VOICE
			I'm sorry... but I think he wants
			to stay.

	The bartender flickers his eyes toward BEVERLY, who is
	also dressed in local clothes, and who holds the
	phaser. The bartender lets go of Yranac.

					BEVERLY
				(to Yranac)
			Sit down.

	Yranac does. Beverly keeps the phaser trained on the
	bartender. Riker leans in to Yranac.

					RIKER
			This --
				(gestures to Beverly)
			-- is my sister.
				(beat)
			She's angry.
				(beat)
			She has a vicious temper. I
			wouldn't cross her.

	Troi joins them and positions herself on the other side
	of Yranac.

					BARTENDER
			You talk and you're a dead man,
			Yranac.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       6.

5    CONTINUED: (3)

	Yranac looks from one to the other, assessing. To
	Riker:

					YRANAC
			Perhaps there is an element of
			risk here that I did not fully
			appreciate.

					WORF
			And how much more latinum will it
			take to offset that risk?

					YRANAC
			This isn't about latinum.
				(spreads his hands)
			As a man with a sister -- a sister
			with a temper -- I can sympathize
			with you. But...
				(beat)
			How did you come here? Do you
			have a ship in orbit?

					RIKER
			Yes...

					YRANAC
			Then take me with you. You can
			drop me anywhere you like.

	Riker and Worf exchange a look.

					RIKER
			Agreed. Now talk.

	Yranac takes a breath.

					YRANAC
			The man you're looking for was
			here several weeks ago. There was
			a group of aliens sitting at this
			table... he was asking them
			questions.

					WORF
			Who were these aliens?

					YRANAC
			I don't know. But they looked
			dangerous.
				(beat)
			They attacked him. He managed to
			incapacitate three of them before
			he was knocked down.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       7.

5    CONTINUED: (4)

	He points to the wall behind him.

					YRANAC
			He was thrown against that wall...
			and fell there.

	Yranac points to a spot on the floor near the wall.
	Beverly hands the phaser to Troi, who keeps it trained
	on the bartender. She pulls out a tricorder and scans
	the wall and floor.

					BEVERLY
			I'm picking up some Starfleet
			fiber traces... and human cellular
			debris.

					RIKER
			Can you establish a DNA sequence?

	Beverly taps a few commands into her tricorder; she
	looks puzzled.

					BEVERLY
			There's something strange here.
			The cell structures are badly
			distorted. It looks as if they've
			been exposed to some kind of high
			energy field.

					WORF
			A weapon discharge?

					BEVERLY
			It could be. There are faint
			traces of micro-crystalline damage
			in the floor material. But I'm
			not familiar with the pattern.

	Yranac stares at her. He's realizing this group is
	other than what they seem.

					YRANAC
			Who are you people?

					RIKER
			You didn't say anything about a
			weapon.

	Yranac is beginning to look a little nervous.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - TEASER       8.

5    CONTINUED: (5)

					YRANAC
				(quickly)
			I hadn't finished yet. You'll
			like this... the man got what was
			coming to him. When they knocked
			him down, one of them took out a
			weapon... and fired.
				(hoping this is wellreceived)
			He was vaporized.

	There's a moment of stunned silence. Yranac looks from
	one to the other, anxiously awaiting their reaction.
	Troi is staring intently at him. Then she turns to
	Riker.

					TROI
			He's telling the truth.

	Off their reactions...

                                             FADE OUT.

	in orbit.

7    INT. SICKBAY

	Beverly is staring at an OKUDAGRAM of a DNA sequence
	displayed on the wall monitor. Riker ENTERS and
	crosses to her.

					RIKER
			Doctor?

	Beverly turns to him; her expression is grim.

					BEVERLY
			There's no question. It's Captain
			Picard's DNA.

	Riker is impassive, his expression unreadable, but it's
	all Beverly can do to keep from breaking down. It's
	hard for her to admit it to herself; she desperately
	wants to find some indication she's wrong, but she
	knows she isn't.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			I used a multi-base progression to
			regenerate the DNA. The technique
			is practically flawless...

	She continues to give her report, attempting to
	submerge her feelings in her work.

					BEVERLY
				(continuing)
			The cellular damage could have
			been caused by a variety of energy
			fields... it's hard to be
			specific. I can't tell whether it
			was the field itself that killed
			him or if he was already dead
			when...

	She trails off, unable to continue. Riker wants to
	comfort her, but there isn't much to say.

   STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 07/27/93 - ACT ONE   10.

7    CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			I'll need your analysis for my
			report to Starfleet.

	She hands him a PADD.

					BEVERLY
			It's all here.

					RIKER
			Thank you.
				(beat)
			I'll inform the crew.

	Riker EXITS. Beverly returns to her work, trying to
	maintain her composure in the face of this tragedy.

                                             CUT TO:

8    INT. RIKER'S QUARTERS

	Riker is working at his desk when door CHIMES.

					RIKER
			Come.

	The DOOR OPENS and Troi ENTERS.

					TROI
			How are you doing?

					RIKER
			I'm all right.

	The words are not convincing.

					TROI
			The crew is pretty shaken up...
			I'm arranging a memorial
			service... I think you should be
			the one to deliver the eulogy.

	There's a long beat before Riker answers.

					RIKER
			You'd be better at something like
			that. Or Beverly. She knew him
			the longest...

	Troi knows he's avoiding.

      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      11.

8    CONTINUED:

					TROI
			I know it won't be easy... but
			it's important for all of us to
			face what's happened. You're in
			command now. The crew will be
			looking to you for guidance --

					RIKER
			You don't understand. I can't
			give the eulogy because I won't be
			at the service.

	Troi is surprised at the extent of his denial.
	Carefully --

					TROI
			A memorial service helps to give
			everyone a sense of completion.
			Helps them begin the healing
			process...

					RIKER
			That's exactly the point. I don't
			want to heal.

					TROI
			Wil --

	He touches his chest.

					RIKER
			I've got an open wound in here, it
			hurts like hell, and I don't want
			it to get better. I don't want to
			believe that everything's all
			right.

					TROI
			You're angry...

					RIKER
			You're damn right. And I intend
			to stay angry -- until I find
			whoever's responsible for the
			Captain's death.

	Troi's patience evaporates. She's hurting, too, and
	her professional demeanor crumbles under the strain.

      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      12.

8    CONTINUED: (2)

					TROI
			That's pretty selfish, Wil.
				(a beat as Riker is
				 taken aback)
			Do you think you're the only one
			in pain? That you have a monopoly
			on loss? Well, I've got news for
			you. We're all hurting... we're
			all angry. And like it or not,
			you've got a responsibility to the
			crew. You can't just indulge your
			personal desire for revenge.

					RIKER
				(harshly)
			That's enough, Counselor.

	They stare at each other, she still bristling, he
	jolted by her anger and vehemence. He regrets his
	attack.

					RIKER
				(continuing, softer)
			I'm sorry.
				(beat)
			Deanna. This isn't about revenge.
			It's about justice. The Captain
			died in a bar fight... for
			nothing. Somebody has to answer
			for that.
				(beat)
			Then I can mourn.

9    INT. BRIDGE

	Riker is in the Captain's chair; Worf is at tactical.
	Various N.D.s in the b.g. ENSIGN GIUSTI is at Ops.

					WORF
			Commander. We are receiving a
			transmission from Admiral Chekote
			at Starbase two-twenty-seven.

					RIKER
			Put it through to the Ready Room.

					WORF
			Aye, sir.

	Riker EXITS to...

      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      13.

10   INT. READY ROOM (OPTICAL)

	As Riker ENTERS, he stops; he stares at Picard's empty
	desk for a brief moment, feeling everything it
	represents... and then, decisively, he moves and sits
	down -- there will be time to remember later.

	He activates the desk terminal, and the image of
	ADMIRAL CHEKOTE appears on the monitor.

					RIKER
			Sir.

					CHEKOTE
			I've read your report, Commander.
			My condolences to you and your
			crew. Captain Picard's death is
			a loss to the entire Federation.
				(beat)
			I see you've asked to postpone
			your mission to the Argus
			sector... for what reason?

					RIKER
			I have a request, sir.
				(beat)
			I'd like to conduct an
			investigation into Captain
			Picard's death.

					CHEKOTE
			The Dessican authorities have
			jurisdiction in this case,
			Commander.

					RIKER
			I know that, sir. But frankly, I
			don't have much confidence in the
			authorities on Dessica Two.
			There's every reason to believe
			they're corrupt.

					CHEKOTE
			I suspect you're right. But the
			question remains... are you the
			one to pursue this?

	A beat, then Chekote nods.

					CHEKOTE
			All right, Commander. I'm

					RIKER
			Thank you, sir.

	Off Riker's determined expression...

11   INT. YRANAC'S QUARTERS

	Riker ENTERS to find Yranac sitting at a table
	surrounded by a huge assortment of food, eating
	heartily. Riker is carrying a PADD.

					YRANAC
			Ah, Commander Riker. I've been
			meaning to speak to you. I was
			wondering if you could move me to
			better quarters. I don't care
			much for the decor here.

					RIKER
			These are the best quarters we
			have.

	Yranac shrugs and continues eating.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Now that you've had some time to
			relax, I was hoping you might have
			remembered some details about the
			aliens you saw... something you'd
			forgotten earlier.

					YRANAC
			Sorry. My memory isn't what it
			used to be.

      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      15.

11   CONTINUED:

	Riker suspects that Yranac knows more than he's
	telling, but Yranac's being cagey -- he's protecting
	every scrap of information he's got so he has something
	to bargain with. Riker's task is to get him to admit
	to as much as he can.

					RIKER
			You said the aliens looked
			dangerous. How could you tell?

					YRANAC
			They killed someone. I'd say that
			qualifies them as dangerous.

					RIKER
			But you said that you noticed they
			looked dangerous before the fight
			even started. What made you think
			that? Were they unusually
			aggressive... ? Were they heavily
			armed... ?

					YRANAC
			I don't recall.

					RIKER
			They murdered a man in plain view
			of everyone in that bar... and you
			can't remember anything about
			them?

					YRANAC
			Now that you mention it, I do
			remember one thing...
				(beat)
			They said they'd kill anyone who
			talked about what happened.

					RIKER
			But you offered to help us.

	Yranac shrugs; he feels secure enough to admit this
	much.

					YRANAC
			You're right. I saw a business
			opportunity. And besides, they
			were gone.

					RIKER
			Do you know where they went?

	Yranac doesn't answer and instead simply smiles.

      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT ONE      16.

11   CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			You know who they are and you know
			where I can find them.

					YRANAC
			Perhaps I do.

					RIKER
			What do you want?

	Yranac thinks he's tantalized Riker enough.

					YRANAC
			Not a great deal, Commander. Just
			a shuttlecraft. I believe I'd
			like to travel for a while, see
			more of the galaxy. You
			understand.

					RIKER
			A shuttlecraft?
				(beat; smiles)
			Well, here's my offer. Instead of
			a ship, I'm going to give you some
			time.

					YRANAC
				(confused)
			Time?

					RIKER
			If you're lucky, you'll only have
			to spend the next five years in
			prison instead of the next twenty.

	Riker grabs Yranac by the front of the shirt and draws
	him to within an inch of his face.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			You've got twelve outstanding
			arrest warrants for fraud and
			petty theft in the Klingon Empire.
			If you tell me what you know, I'll
			pull a few strings... maybe get
			them to reduce your sentence after
			you're extradited.

	Yranac is in a full-blown panic.

11   CONTINUED: (3)

					YRANAC
			You can't turn me over to the
			Klingons. They don't just
			imprison you... Do you know what
			the punishment is for fraud?

	Riker knows exactly what it is.

					RIKER
			Yes. I certainly do.

	Yranac is terrified at the prospect, but he's still
	trying to bargain his way out.

					YRANAC
			If I tell you what I know, you
			must promise you won't give me to
			the Klingons.

					RIKER
			I'll think about it.

					YRANAC
			Perhaps you could send me to a
			Federation rehabilitation colony
			instead.

					RIKER
			Talk!

	Yranac slumps; he's played all his cards and he's lost.
	His only chance now is to tell the truth.

					YRANAC
			The aliens were some kind of
			mercenary group. They've been
			operating in this sector for the
			last six months.

					RIKER
			Where do we find them?

					YRANAC
			I heard one of them mention the
			Barradas system... I think they
			were headed there.

					RIKER
			You think?

					YRANAC
				(miserable)
			That's all I know.

	Riker, Geordi, Worf, and two Security Officers, N.D. #1
	and N.D. #2, are in a large clearing. The forest has
	encroached on a variety of simple ruins; however, in
	several places through the site, there are strange
	INDENTATIONS in the ground: smooth, circularly-shaped
	holes which almost suggest that something was scooped
	away.

	Geordi, Worf and N.D. #1 are equipped with tricorders;
	the entire team is armed with phasers.

   STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 07/27/93 - ACT TWO   21.

17   RIKER AND GEORDI

	are standing together as Geordi scans the site; the
	others continue working in the b.g.

	Geordi works his tricorder with frustration; he's
	having trouble getting clear readings.

					GEORDI
			It's tough to get accurate sensor
			readings... there's a lot of
			interference in the area.

					RIKER
			From what?

					GEORDI
			I'm not sure... it's unlocalized.
			It could be atmospheric...

					RIKER
			What do you make of this?

	Riker moves near one of the circular indentations in
	the ground. Geordi kneels down and examines the ground
	with his VISOR.

					GEORDI
			The ruins are ancient... but I'd
			say this indentation was made
			fairly recently...
				(unconvinced)
			There might have been a battle
			here...

	Riker looks at the indentation.

					RIKER
			It doesn't look like any blast

18   ANOTHER ANGLE - WORF (OPTICAL)

	Worf is standing near the edge of the clearing with
	N.D. #1. Riker and Geordi move to join them.

					WORF
				(continuing)
			I have found something.

	Worf points down at TWO ARTIFACTS which are lying in
	the grass. There are no other ruins nearby, and the
	artifacts look completely out of place where they are.
	Riker stares at them, puzzled.

					RIKER
				(musing)
			It almost looks as if someone...
			dropped them --

	Without warning, a PHASER BLAST hits N.D. #1 square in
	the chest; he goes down instantly.

	Geordi and Worf dive for safety behind some nearby
	ruins; Riker and N.D. #2 are forced away from the
	others in order to find cover.

19   THE SCENE (OPTICAL)

	The phaser fire came from the trees ahead of the Away
	Team; as the action plays out, we will see the
	attackers. They are a team of THREE ARMED MERCENARIES:
	the leader, a Romulan female, TALLERA; a large,
	intimidating alien female, VEKOR; and an alien male,
	NARIK.

	(Note: while their individual uniforms are different,

	attached to their necks.)

	Protected by covering fire, Tallera rushes out into the
	clearing, grabs the two artifacts, and dives back into
	cover.

	Our people quickly return fire with their phasers, but
	the mercenaries have us outgunned -- both halves of the

36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE

	Tallera (the Romulan female we saw earlier) is leading
	a groggy Riker across the room as he struggles
	painfully back to consciousness. Riker's combadge is
	gone and there is now a small patch-like device (like
	all the other mercenaries wear) at the side of his
	throat.

	The mercenary bridge is sleek and spare with no wasted
	space, just like everything on this ship. A large
	Viewscreen dominates the forward section and there's a
	small Transporter pad in one corner. The walls are
	lined with consoles which are manned by various N.D.
	MERCENARIES. The ALERT LIGHTS are active, and there is
	a tense, urgent feeling on the bridge.

	In the center of the bridge is a raised platform
	encircled by a rail and a console. From here, the
	Captain commands an unobstructed view of the entire
	room. It should feel as though this ship and crew are
	always ready for battle.

	Tallera pushes Riker against the rail and stares at him
	silently.

	The mercenary captain, BARAN, stands on his platform.
	He's a humanoid male alien, intelligent, muscular -- a
	man to be reckoned with. Baran is wearing a small
	CONTROL DEVICE at his belt.

	Baran is engaged in a heated conversation with the
	engineer, Narik, and for the moment, ignores Riker and
	Tallera.

					NARIK
				(upset)
			I warned you not to push the

			I can try to realign the warp

	Narik glares angrily at Baran but does not dispute him.
	He nods and moves to a console in the b.g. Baran then
	turns and stares coldly at Riker.

					BARAN
			What were you doing on Barradas
			Three?

					RIKER
				(all I'm saying)
			William T. Riker, Commander, SC
			two-three-one dash four-two-seven.

	Baran cocks his head and regards him. Is he going to

					BARAN
			All right. I am Arctus Baran...
			and I don't have a number.
				(beat)
			Now. What were you doing on
			Barradas Three -- Commander?

					RIKER
			We were studying the ruins. It

					BARAN
			Don't patronize me. Those ruins
			have been studied for centuries.
			There's nothing new to learn from
			them.

					RIKER
			Then what were you doing there?

	Baran smiles, acknowledging the riposte. Then he takes
	the device at his belt and activates it. Riker sinks
	to his knees, gasping, in tremendous pain.
	Instinctively, he tries to pull the patch off his neck.

					BARAN
			Don't bother, Commander, you can't
			remove it. It's a neural servo.
			It's connected directly to your
			nervous system.

	Narik steps forward.

					NARIK
			Vekor's right -- we should get rid

					BARAN
			Dangerous? It might be

38   INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (CONTINUOUS)

	Riker is completely stunned at the sight of Picard, but
	he quickly controls himself -- before he says anything,
	he has to figure out what's going on here.

	Picard, however, doesn't even give Riker a second
	glance; his attention is focused entirely on Baran.

					PICARD
				(re: Riker)
			If he has nothing to give us, then
			we should kill him now and be done
			with it. Everyone seems to
			recognize that fact except you.

	Picard speaks harshly, with a violent edge that's only
	barely restrained.

					BARAN
			I don't need a consensus to run
			this ship, Galen.

	This is not the first argument Baran and Picard have
	had, and the hostility between the two men is evident.
	Picard is about to respond when suddenly, the SHIP
	SHUDDERS slightly and the LIGHTS DIM.

					BARAN
				(quickly)
			What's going on?

	Narik quickly moves to monitor one of the consoles in
	the b.g.

					NARIK
			We're bypassing the aft plasma
			couplings... the power loss should
			only last a few seconds...

	A short beat passes and the lights return to normal.
	Baran returns his attention to Picard.

					BARAN
			You should learn not to limit your
			options. Riker could be useful to
			us in the future.

					PICARD
			He may not be as useful as you

	Picard moves toward Riker.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			... if this is the same Riker I've
			heard about.

	Riker is deeply confused; he doesn't know what Picard
	is doing or how to react to it. For now, he's just got
	to try and play along.

					RIKER
				(to Picard)
			And which "Riker" is that?

					PICARD
			Commander of the Enterprise... ?
			Formerly assigned to the USS
			Hood... ?

					RIKER
			That's right.

					PICARD
			Then you must be the William T.
			Riker with a history of
			insubordination...

	As Picard continues to speak, Riker begins to pick up
	something in his tone and manner -- he senses where
	Picard's going with this.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			He was even relieved of duty once,
			during the Cardassian incident at
			Minos Korva.

	Picard's story has thrown Baran off balance.

				(taunting)
			If we hadn't captured him, he
			probably would've ended up in

	By now, Riker understands what Picard has been trying
	to set up, and he plays into it.

				(to Baran)
			He's no use to us. Finish him now

	But before Baran can reply, the SHIP SHUDDERS again.
	For a moment, everyone thinks it's just Narik making
	repairs like before... and then suddenly, the ship
	LURCHES FORWARD, accelerating rapidly; the ALARM
	KLAXONS sound.

	Baran reacts, concerned; he shoves Riker toward an ND
	Mercenary.

					BARAN
				(to ND)
			Watch him.

	The argument is quickly forgotten as Baran, Tallera,
	Narik, Vekor, and Picard rush to the consoles. The
	WHINE of the ship's engines begins to get louder...

					BARAN
				(to Narik, accusing)
			What have you done?

					NARIK
			It has nothing to do with my
			repairs...
				(works console)
			I think there's a malfunction in
			the engine's intermix chamber...

					VEKOR
			We're accelerating...

					TALLERA
			Plasma pressure is rising...

					BARAN
			Where's the malfunction?

					NARIK
			It could be any one of thirty
			subsystems. It'll take time to
			locate...

					TALLERA
			I don't think you're going to have
			the chance. Plasma pressure is

				(works console)
			I can't... the override sequence
			won't engage...

39   ANGLE ON PICARD

	as he works his console.

					PICARD
			It's the antimatter flow

	As Baran rushes over to inspect Picard's panel, for a

	catches the glance -- what's Picard up to now?

					NARIK
			We have to jettison the core...

					BARAN
			No! We'll be stranded here --

					PICARD
			The flow regulator is frozen...

	Riker catches Picard's eye for a moment -- and realizes
	what's going on -- Picard has created the malfunction
	specifically for Riker to fix.

					RIKER
			Let me do it.

	Baran and the others react.

	Baran really has no other option.

					BARAN
				(to Riker)
			Go!

	Riker rushes to Picard's console, works the commands,
	and quickly studies the readout.

					RIKER
			It looks like you've got a control

	He begins to work the panel...

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			I'm going to try to run an active

	He pushes Narik towards another console.

				(continuing)
			Start running a phase-locked

			We'll all be dead anyway.
				(beat, works)
			Just a few more seconds...

	Picard turns his attention back to the sample, but
	Tallera moves to the console and turns off the scanner.

					TALLERA
			Do you enjoy living dangerously,
			Galen? Baran can kill you in an
			instant if he activates his
			control device...

	Tallera's manner is friendly, even seductive. She's
	trying to draw Picard out, figure him out.

					PICARD
			I doubt he'll do that. I've
			increased the accuracy of the
			identification process by a factor
			of ten. I'm the best person here
			to analyze these artifacts, and
			Baran knows it.

	He snaps the scanner back on and places another
	artifact on the pad.

					PICARD
			Computer, begin scan.

					TALLERA
			He may need you now -- but I know
			Baran, and I can tell you he's not
			going to back down forever.
				(beat)
			You accomplish nothing by
			provoking him.

	Picard turns to her. He might be able to use this
	opportunity to get some information himself.

	In the background, we hear the computer voice:

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Scan complete.

					PICARD
			I don't like operating in the
			dark. If I knew what the point of
			this mission were... why I'm
			scanning these relics...

					TALLERA
			If Baran felt it were wise to let
			the crew know that, I'm sure he
			would have.

	A beat as Picard assesses her.

          STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE         52.

50   CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
			Do you know what this is all
			about?

	She smiles, an enigmatic smile that suggests a special
	relationship between her and Baran.

					TALLERA
			What Baran knows, I know...

					PICARD
			Then tell me what we're doing
			here. Why are we risking our
			lives taking these artifacts? Who
			wants them?

					TALLERA
			I see no reason to tell you
			anything... but you can rest
			assured I don't necessarily share
			everything I know with Baran,
			either.

	A beat as she moves closer to him.

					TALLERA
				(softly)
			This conversation, for example...
			will stay between us.

	He gives her a look. Is there a hint of complicity?
	Of seduction?

	He can't be sure what this mysterious woman is getting
	at, but he certainly doesn't trust her.

					PICARD
			You can tell him every word I've
			said. He knows I don't think he's
			much of a leader.

	Tallera takes a step back, as though feeling a rebuff.
	The edge has returned to her voice.

					TALLERA
			He's been in charge of this crew
			for a long time.

					PICARD
			He wouldn't be captain for five
			minutes if he didn't have the
			control device.
					(MORE)

          STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE         53.

50   CONTINUED: (4)

					PICARD (Cont'd)
			The crew follows him because they
			have no choice. Baran's power is
			based only on fear and
			intimidation.

	Tallera regards him gravely, probing, trying to assess
	him.

					TALLERA
			That almost sounds like a prelude
			to mutiny...

					PICARD
			If someone were to challenge Baran --
			the crew would follow.

					TALLERA
			I was right. You do like living
			dangerously...

	There is a beat as she moves closer to him.

					TALLERA
			I like you, Galen. I can tolerate
			a lot from someone like you... but
			only to a point.
				(beat)
			I intend to complete this mission
			successfully and get what's been
			promised me. If it looks as
			though you're getting in the way
			of that... I'll deal with you
			myself.

	She turns and EXITS. Picard stares after her, trying
	to gauge just how formidable she really is.

                                             CUT TO:

51   EXT. SPACE - THE MERCENARY SHIP (OPTICAL)

	enters orbit around Calder Two.

          STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE         54.

52   INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Picard, Tallera, Narik, and Vekor are in the b.g. at
	various stations. Riker is talking to a Starfleet
	Officer, LIEUTENANT SANDERS, on a monitor at one of the
	consoles. Baran stands nearby, out of view of the
	screen, watching Riker carefully.

					SANDERS
			Commander, no one is allowed on
			the surface without prior
			authorization from the Federation
			Science Council.

					RIKER
			I'm aware of that, Lieutenant, but
			the outpost is in imminent danger
			of attack. I want to station
			security personnel on the surface
			to protect you.
				(beat)
			I am ordering you to drop your
			shields.

	Sanders takes his time considering.

					SANDERS
			I'm sorry, sir... but the
			regulations are very specific. I
			can't do it.
				(beat)
			If you like, you can remain in
			orbit until we contact the Science
			Council, but we're experiencing
			some communication difficulties
			right now, so it might take some
			time --

	Baran abruptly cuts off the transmission.

					BARAN
				(angry)
			They're delaying on purpose.
			Someone has warned them.

	Baran gestures to an N.D. at the weapons console.

					BARAN
			Charge main disruptor array...
			destroy the outpost.

	Picard sees that although there's no longer any way to
	avoid a battle, there might still be a way to save the
	people below -- but he has to act quickly. Picard
	moves to the weapons console and moves the N.D. out of
	the way...

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 07/28/93 - ACT FIVE      54A.

52   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			That would take too long.
			Starfleet might be here any
			minute...

	Picard begins working the console...

					BARAN
			What are you doing?

					PICARD
			I'm configuring the disruptors to
			fire a phase-resonant pulse... If
			I can hit their shield generator
			at precisely the right frequency,
			I should be able to knock it off-line
			with a single shot...
				(beat)
			Firing...

	We hear the SOUND of disruptors firing... A tense
	beat...

					PICARD
				(off console)
			Their shields are down...

	Baran and Picard exchange a brief glance.

53   BARAN

	moves quickly to Tallera's station. Tallera is
	studying her console intently.

          STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE         55.

53   CONTINUED:

					BARAN
			The artifacts should be located in
			several small structures...
			arranged in staggered
			formations...

					TALLERA
			I'm scanning...

	Tallera works the console for a beat.

					TALLERA
			I think I've found them.

					BARAN
			Lock the coordinates and start
			bringing them up.

	Tallera works her console...

54   ANGLE ON TRANSPORTER (OPTICAL)

	as several artifacts MATERIALIZE on the Transporter
	pad.

55   RESUME SCENE

					BARAN
			There should be at least two more
			pieces down there.

					TALLERA
				(off console)
			I've got them --

	Tallera suddenly looks up from her console.

					TALLERA
				(continuing)
			I've lost transporter lock.

	Picard breaks in.

					PICARD
			They've managed to get their
			shields back up.

	Baran moves to Picard.

					BARAN
			I need those artifacts. Lock all
			disruptors on target... this time
			I want that outpost destroyed.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 07/27/93 - ACT FIVE       56.

55   CONTINUED: (2)

	Picard reacts -- there's no way he can disobey the
	order... Picard moves to the weapons control
	station...

	Suddenly, the SHIP SHAKES -- it's been hit.

56   OMITTED

57   INT. BRIDGE

	Data is at command and Troi is at her station; Worf is
	at tactical and Giusti at ops.

					WORF
			Direct hit on their aft deflector,
			sir... They are undamaged.

					DATA
			Ensign, scan for Starfleet
			combadge signals. Is Commander
			Riker aboard that ship?

					GIUSTI
				(works console)
			I can't tell, sir. Sensors are
			unable to penetrate their hull.

					DATA
			Open a channel.

			This is the Federation Starship
			Enterprise. You are ordered to
			stand down...

58   CONTINUED:

	Baran instantly accuses Riker.

					BARAN
			You sent them a message... you
			told them where to find us.

					RIKER
			That's ridiculous... when did I
			have the chance?

	Baran has one option left. He takes out his pain
	control device and shows it pointedly to Riker.

					BARAN
				(re: device)
			This is set to kill.
				(beat)
			Order your ship to disengage.

	He shoves Riker in front of the main Viewscreen.

					BARAN
				(to N.D. Mercenary)
			Activate visual.

59   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Riker appears on the Viewscreen. Reactions all around.

			Commander. Are you all right?

60   INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

					BARAN
				(insistent)
			Tell them!

	Riker has an idea... he's going to make a desperate
	gamble.

					RIKER
				(hard)
			Withdraw the Enterprise, Mister
			Data. That's an order.

          STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - 07/26/93 - ACT FIVE         58.

60   CONTINUED:

					DATA
				(puzzled)
			Sir, that is impossible. The ship
			you are on has violated a
			Federation outpost. It is my duty
			to stop it.

					RIKER
			I'm your commanding officer and
			I'm giving you a direct order.
			Understood?

	Worf and Data exchange a look. What the hell is going
	on?

			Commander, if you could explain --

61   INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

					RIKER
			I've never explained my orders to
			you before and I'm not going to
			start now.

	Riker cuts off the transmission and turns quickly to
	Baran.

					RIKER
			I have no intention of letting
			them blow us into space.
				(beat)
			If I can set up a low energy com
			link between the ships... I can
			use my personal command codes to
			deactivate their shields.

	Baran looks at him for a quick beat and then indicates
	a nearby console.

					BARAN
			Do it.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 07/28/93 - ACT FIVE       59.

61   CONTINUED:

	Riker moves to the console and begins working
	furiously.

62   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE

	Everyone is still mystified by Riker's behavior.

					DATA
			Counselor, could Commander Riker
			have been drugged or mentally
			altered in some way to explain
			this?

					TROI
			I didn't sense anything which
			would indicate that...

					WORF
				(off console)
			Commander, we are receiving some
			kind of signal from the mercenary
			ship...
				(beat; astonished)
			These are Commander Riker's access
			codes... he is attempting to shut
			down our shields...

					TROI
			That doesn't make any sense. He
			knows those codes would have been
			changed as soon as he was
			captured...

	A beat as Data considers this strange situation.
	Then...

					DATA
			That is correct, Counselor. He
			does know.
				(beat)
			Mister Worf. Prepare to drop the
			shields.

					WORF
				(astonished)
			Sir? We will be totally
			defenseless.

					DATA
			I am aware of that.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part I" - REV. 07/27/93 - ACT FIVE       60.

62   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			The moment they see our --

					DATA
			That is an order.

	A beat.

					WORF
			Aye-aye, sir.

	Reluctantly, Worf works his console.

63   INT. MERCENARY SHIP

	Riker, Picard, Baran, and Tallera are gathered around
	a console.

					RIKER
			It worked! Their shields are
			dropping...

	Baran turns to Picard.

					BARAN
			Fire!

	Picard exchanges a look with Riker... and presses the

1    INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

	As seen at the end of Part I -- DATA, TROI, WORF, and
	GIUSTI in their places. The ship is ROCKED SLIGHTLY by
	the blast from the Mercenary ship.

					WORF
			Direct hit to the port nacelle...
				(beat, then surprised)
			But -- only minimal damage.

	Another SHAKE.

					WORF
				(continuing)
			Hit on the starboard nacelle...
			again, no appreciable damage.

					TROI
			Wil must've done something to
			their weapons.

					DATA
			I believe so, Counselor. It is
			now up to us to... play along.
				(to Giusti)
			Release inertial dampers and cut
			power on decks thirty-one through
			thirty-seven.
				(to Worf)
			Set phasers to twenty-five
			percent. Return fire.

			Aye, sir.

					BARAN
				(to Picard)
			Continue firing!

					PICARD
				(off console)
			We've lost three plasma relays on

			power... is not available.

					BARAN
				(exasperated)
			Transfer weapons control to my
			station. There's a way to by-pass
			the relays and feed power --

	The ship is ROCKED again.

					NARIK
			The anti-matter containment unit
			is starting to buckle!

	Tallera moves quickly and smoothly to Baran.

					TALLERA
				(urgent, quiet)
			The Enterprise has been badly
			damaged but they still have
			superior firepower. If we remain
			here, we will be destroyed. The
			logical course of action is to
			withdraw.

	Baran doesn't want to go, but another SHAKE convinces
	him. Baran's next words are intended for public
	consumption.

					BARAN
				(loudly)
			We've done enough damage. Narik,
			set course one eight zero, mark
			two one five. Warp six.
			Initiate.

	Narik works the console. Across the Bridge, Riker and

				(off console)
			They're preparing to activate
			their warp drive, Commander.

					WORF
				(urgent)
			Sir. We will not be able to track
			them with our sensors if they go
			to warp. I can still disable them
			before they --

					DATA
			I am aware of the tactical
			situation, Lieutenant. Let them
			go.

	Worf glares at the image of the Mercenary ship on the
	Viewscreen as it begins to move away from the

	FADE IN:

          (NOTE: Episode credits fall over opening scenes.)            

6    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	The ship hangs in space.

7    INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

	Worf at Tactical, Troi and GEORDI at the aft science
	stations, Giusti at Ops. Data moves from station to
	station, and people automatically report to him as he
	approaches.

					GIUSTI
				(off console)
			Sensor sweep eight has been
			completed, sir. Still no sign of
			the mercenary ship.

					DATA
			Understood. Begin sensor sweep
			nine using the lateral array set
			to maximum gain.

					GIUSTI
			Aye, sir.

	Data makes his way to the aft stations.

8    INCLUDE TROI (OPTICAL)

	On the monitor in front of Troi is a video replay of
	Riker's last Viewscreen transmission from Part I. Troi
	FREEZES the image as Data approaches.

					TROI
			I've gone over every word, every
			inflection, every facial
			response... but I still haven't
			found any kind of code or hidden
			message.

					DATA
			Understood. I agree that the
			probability that such a message
			exists is remote, but I believe we
			should check.

      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE      5.

8    CONTINUED:

					TROI
			I'll keep trying.

	She returns to the console and Data turns to Worf.

					WORF
				(to Data)
			Two starships have been sent to
			intercept the mercenaries at
			Yadalla Prime and Draken Four, in
			case they attempt to attack those
			planets.

					DATA
			Very well. Inform Starfleet
			Command that we will hold position
			here until further notice.

					WORF
			So we are just going to... remain
			here?

					DATA
			Yes. But we will continue to
			pursue all avenues of
			investigation which are available
			to us.

					WORF
			If we had not allowed them to
			escape, this would not be
			necessary.

	Data thinks about this for a beat.

					DATA
			That is correct. However, I
			believe Commander Riker wanted us
			to let them escape.

	Suddenly Geordi sees something on his monitor.

					GEORDI
				(excited)
			I think I've got something.

	Data moves to Geordi's console. On the monitor is an
	OKUDAGRAM of an intricate series of numbers and letters --
	clearly some kind of code.

					GEORDI
				(continuing)
			I've been studying the com link
			Commander Riker used to transmit
			his command codes.

8    CONTINUED: (2)

					GEORDI (Cont'd)
			I didn't see anything at first,
			but when I ran the transmission
			through a sub-harmonic analysis I
			found this.
				(indicates graphic)
			It was sent on the same carrier
			wave as the command codes.

	Data and Troi look at the monitor.

					TROI
				(to Data)
			It might be the message you've
			been looking for.

	Data sits down at the console and begins to rapidly
	work the controls.

					DATA
			Possibly. I will attempt to resequence
			the signal.
				(to Geordi)
			Begin running a search for a
			decryption key.

	As Data and Geordi work...

9    EXT. SPACE - THE MERCENARY SHIP (OPTICAL)

	The ship comes to a STOP near a large planet.

10   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE

	Baran in command. Picard, Riker, Tallera, Vekor, and
	Narik at their stations.

					NARIK
				(off console)
			I'm taking the engines off-line.

					BARAN
			How long until we can repair our
			battle damage?

					NARIK
			It will take at least five hours
			to replace the anti-matter
			containment unit.

      STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE      7.

10   CONTINUED:

					BARAN
			You have three hours, Narik. One
			minute beyond that and you'll
			answer for it with your life.

	Narik glares at Baran, but has little choice except to
	nod and EXIT the Bridge. Baran turns his attention to
	Riker, who seems lost in thought near one of the
	consoles. Picard is standing nearby.

					BARAN
				(to Riker)
			I suppose I should thank you.
			None of us would be alive if it
			weren't for you.

	But Riker doesn't seem to appreciate Baran's thanks.
	His tone is bitter and downcast.

					RIKER
				(bitter)
			You're welcome.

	Picard moves smoothly in and begins to mercilessly
	torment Riker. In the b.g. Tallera watches their
	interchange with a thoughtful expression.

					PICARD
			What's wrong, Commander? Starting
			to have second thoughts about
			betraying your comrades... because
			that's what you've done --
			betrayed them... betrayed them in
			order to save yourself.
				(beat)
			You were just a second-rate
			officer before... now you're a
			coward and a traitor. How does
			that feel?

	Riker gives him a cool look... then, without warning,
	Riker HITS Picard squarely in the jaw, knocking him off
	his feet.

					RIKER
			I don't know. How did that feel?

	Picard's eyes flash and he gets up and moves toward
	Riker.

10   CONTINUED: (2)

					BARAN
				(hard)
			That's enough.
				(to Picard)
			Galen, get down to the cargo hold
			and check those artifacts.
				(beat)
			Move.

	Picard and Riker continue to glare at each other, then
	Picard seems to back down and he EXITS.

11   TALLERA

	Looks from Baran to Riker... thinks for a few beats,
	then EXITS.

                                             CUT TO:

12   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - CARGO BAY

	Picard is checking over a group of NEW ARTIFACTS (a few
	pieces of exotic pottery, ancient weapons, tools, etc.)
	on the scanner pad. Picard makes a note on a PADD and
	takes a relic off the scanner. He begins to examine
	another relic. The doors OPEN and Tallera ENTERS.
	Picard doesn't look up.

					PICARD
				(irritated)
			Tell Baran I'm working as fast as
			I can.

	Tallera just studies him without responding... she's
	getting suspicious. Picard turns and looks at her.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			What?

					TALLERA
			I'm trying to decide if you're
			incredibly stupid... or incredibly
			smart. Why didn't you continue to
			fire on the Enterprise when their
			shields dropped?

   STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT ONE   9.

12   CONTINUED:

	Picard turns back to his work, and as they talk, he
	continues to make complex adjustments to the strange
	equipment -- sometimes hooking up new devices,
	discarding others, etc.

					PICARD
			You were there. The disruptors
			lost power.
				(to computer)
			Computer, reset diagnostic for new
			sample and begin scan.

					TALLERA
			I've watched you handle the weapon
			systems before. You know exactly
			how to by-pass a problem like
			that.
				(beat)
			And why do you continue to argue
			with Riker? It should be obvious
			that by alienating him you are
			also alienating Baran, and yet you
			continue to do it. Why?

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Scan complete. Terikon profile
			negative.

	Picard removes the artifact and replaces it with
	another one -- this ARTIFACT has several intricate
	designs on the side and is shaped like a large puzzle
	piece. Picard is deliberately taking a challenging
	attitude in order to maintain his cover and throw
	Tallera off.

					PICARD
				(sarcastic)
			I'm touched by your concern for my
			well-being.

					TALLERA
			That's not an answer.

     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     10.

12   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Computer, reset diagnostic and
			begin scan.
				(to Tallera)
			I'm not a prisoner in a Romulan
			labor camp, Tallera. I don't have
			to answer your questions and I
			don't give a damn what you think.

	Tallera studies his face for a moment.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Scan complete. Terikon profile
			positive. Ninety-eight percent
			probability of match.

	They both turn and look at the artifact on the scanner
	pad.

					PICARD
			Well, whatever it is... it looks
			like we've found it.

	Tallera moves to the artifact and looks at it closely
	for a long beat, her expression becomes cool and
	unreadable.

					TALLERA
				(touches com device)
			Tallera to Captain.

					BARAN'S COM VOICE
			Yes?

					TALLERA
			I'm in the cargo hold. Galen's
			made a positive Terikon match on
			one of the artifacts.

					BARAN'S COM VOICE
			Is he sure?

					TALLERA
			He's sure.

13   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS

	In contrast to the other quarters on the mercenary
	ship, Baran's quarters border on the luxurious...
	overstuffed furniture, gaudy sculpture -- very
	decadent. Baran is lounging in a chair while Riker
	sits on a couch... Baran holds a drink.

     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     11.

13   CONTINUED:

					BARAN
				(excited, to com)
			Good. Bring it here immediately
			and don't let anyone else get near
			it.

					TALLERA'S COM VOICE
			Understood. Tallera out.

	Baran takes a long, very satisfying drink from his
	glass and settles back into his chair.

					RIKER
			I take it that's good news.

					BARAN
			Very. It means we've completed
			half of what promises to be a very
			profitable mission... and even
			better than that it means, I'm
			almost ready to get rid of your
			friend Galen.

					RIKER
			Really?

					BARAN
				(nods)
			We have only one more artifact to
			find... and once Galen confirms
			it's genuine, his usefulness on
			this ship will come to a very
			sudden end.

					RIKER
			I can't say I'm sorry to hear
			that.

	Baran studies Riker closely for a moment... he's not
	quite sure what to make of him... he might have an ally
	here, but Baran is wary and suspicious by his very
	nature.

					BARAN
			I'm sure.
				(beat)
			Galen may be a loud-mouthed fool,
			but sometimes he can be very
			perceptive... his observations
			about you for instance.

					RIKER
			Oh?

   STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT ONE   12.

13   CONTINUED: (2)

					BARAN
			After what you did at Calder Two,
			I doubt you have much of a future
			in Starfleet.

					RIKER
			I've... pretty much come to the
			same conclusion.

					BARAN
			Assuming for the moment that you
			were no longer my prisoner... what
			would you do now?

	Riker thinks about this for a moment... then gives
	Baran a very direct look.

					RIKER
			I guess I'd have to look for a new
			career... there must be a place
			where someone with fifteen years
			of Starfleet technical knowledge
			would be useful.
				(beat)
			Do you know of any place like
			that?

	Baran takes a drink... he's not going to rush into
	anything.

					BARAN
			Possibly.
				(beat)
			But if there's one thing I've
			learned on this ship, it's to be
			cautious... and not to blindly
			embrace what seems to be good
			fortune. And at the moment, you
			seem like a rather large stroke of
			luck.

					RIKER
			I haven't exactly sworn my undying
			allegiance to you, Baran. In
			fact, I'd like to know a little
			bit more about the job.

					BARAN
			Such as?

     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     12A.

13   CONTINUED: (3)

					RIKER
			Such as what you meant by a "very
			profitable mission."

					BARAN
				(smiles)
			I thought you Starfleet types
			weren't interested in things like
			profit.

					RIKER
			I'm not exactly... the "ideal"
			Starfleet type.

					BARAN
			No, I guess you're not.
				(beat)
			All you need to know for now is
			that your share could be more than
			enough to insure a very long and
			very wealthy life far away from
			the Federation.

					RIKER
			Sounds promising.

     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT ONE     13.

13   CONTINUED: (4)

					BARAN
			It is. But if you want that
			share, you'll have to earn it.
				(beat)
			And you can start by putting aside
			your dislike for Galen and trying
			to become his friend.

	Riker reacts as if this is a particularly unpleasant
	request.

					RIKER
			Why?

					BARAN
			Galen has allies among the crew...
			they might cause a problem if I
			kill him. I want you to get close
			to him and find out who they are.

					RIKER
			Okay.

	Riker stands to go, but Baran stops him.

					BARAN
			One more thing, Riker.
				(beat)
			When the time comes, I want you to
			kill Galen.

	A beat and then Riker nods... OFF his expression...

                                             FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

14   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

	Data is sitting at the aft science station as Worf and
	Geordi look on. Giusti at Ops. The monitor screen
	shows an OKUDAGRAM image of a sequence of numbers and
	letters which have been arranged into some kind of
	pattern.

					DATA
			I have completed the analysis of
			the signal from the mercenary
			ship. I believe these groupings
			represent bearings and coordinates
			taken from their navigational
			system.

					GEORDI
			So you think this is their flight
			plan...

					DATA
			Yes. If I am correct, the
			mercenary vessel is heading toward
			these coordinates in...
				(works)
			... the Hyralan Sector.

					WORF
			Their maximum speed is warp eight
			point seven... it will take them
			at least fourteen hours to reach
			that position.

					GEORDI
			We could be there in five.

	Data turns to Worf.

					DATA
			Make it so.

					WORF
				(annoyed)
			Finally.

	Data reacts to the tone of irritation in Worf's voice,
	but says nothing as Worf tends to the business at hand.

					WORF
				(continuing, to Con
				 Officer)
			Set course for the Hyralan Sector
			and engage at warp nine.

14   CONTINUED:

	Data moves quietly to Worf.

					DATA
			Lieutenant, may I see you in the
			Ready Room?

					WORF
			Of course.

	Data and Worf EXIT.

15   INT. READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS

	Data and Worf ENTER. Once the doors close, Data turns
	around and confronts Worf without preamble.

					DATA
			Lieutenant, I am dissatisfied with
			your performance as acting first
			officer.

					WORF
				(surprised)
			May I... ask in what way?

					DATA
			You continually question my orders
			in front of the crew. I do not
			think this is appropriate
			behavior.

					WORF
			Sir... with all due respect, I
			have always felt free to voice my
			opinions... even when they
			differed from those of Captain
			Picard or Commander Riker.

					DATA
			That is true. But in those
			situations, you were acting as
			head of security, not as First
			Officer. The primary role of the
			second in command is to carry out
			the decisions of the Captain... in
			this case, me.

					WORF
			But is it not my duty to offer
			you... alternatives?

   STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/06/93 - ACT TWO   16.

15   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Yes. But once I have made a
			decision, it is your job to carry
			it out regardless of how you may
			personally feel. Any further
			objections should be given to me
			in private, not in front of the
			crew.
				(beat)
			I do not recall Commander Riker
			ever publicly showing irritation
			with his Captain as you did a
			moment ago.

					WORF
				(abashed)
			No, sir.

					DATA
			If you feel that you are not
			capable of carrying out this role,
			I can assign it to Commander La
			Forge and return you to Tactical.
			I would not enter it as a
			reprimand on your record... simply
			as a transfer.

					WORF
			I would... prefer to remain at my
			current post.

					DATA
			Then I will expect you to conform
			to the guidelines I have laid out.

					WORF
			Aye, sir.

	Worf turns to go, then Data stops him.

					DATA
			Mister Worf... I am sorry if I
			have ended our friendship.

	Worf looks at him for a moment... suddenly feeling a
	sense of remorse at his behavior.

					WORF
			Sir... it is I who has jeopardized
			our friendship, not you. If you
			will... overlook this incident, I
			would like to continue to consider
			myself your friend.

					DATA
			I would like that as well.

     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT TWO     17.

15   CONTINUED: (2)

					WORF
			Thank you, sir.

16   EXT. MERCENARY SHIP (OPTICAL)

	The ship hangs in space.

17   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE

	Baran and Riker are standing over Narik, who is working
	at his engineering console. Vekor is working at a
	console in the b.g.

					BARAN
				(with an edge)
			Your time is almost up, Narik. I
			need warp power.

					NARIK
				(working)
			You can't rush this, Baran... if
			the constrictor coil isn't
			perfectly aligned, the entire antimatter
			containment unit could
			rupture... and that would be the
			end of the engines, the ship, and
			us.

					BARAN
				(brusque)
			I don't have time for your
			excuses. We have a schedule to
			keep.
				(to Riker)
			Can you do this any faster?

	Riker notes that Baran's hand has dropped to his
	control device... a word from Riker and Narik is dead.
	Narik realizes this as well and he gives Riker a
	worried look. Riker looks over the console, seems to
	consider this.

					RIKER
			I think Narik may be right this
			time... a constrictor coil will
			only align so fast. We'll have to
			wait.

     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT TWO     18.

17   CONTINUED:

					BARAN
			How long?

	Riker studies the console for a moment.

					RIKER
			I'd say another hour, maybe less.

	Baran turns to Narik, a cold and unforgiving look on
	his face.

					BARAN
			One hour.

	Narik returns to work with a renewed spirit of vigor as
	Baran and Riker move away from him. Baran moves
	casually to Vekor.

					BARAN
				(to Vekor)
			Where is Galen?

					VEKOR
			In his quarters.

	Baran gives Riker a meaningful look as he speaks, but
	keeps his ovice casual.

					BARAN
			Typical. Everyone else is working
			and he's asleep. Someone should
			go kick him out of bed.

	Riker gives a slight nod... he understands what Baran
	wants of him.

					RIKER
			I'll take care of it.

					BARAN
			Good.

	Riker EXITS.

	A small, cramped room with only the barest of

	whips out a phaser. Riker freezes in the open doorway
	for a moment, then Picard motions him inside.

18   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
				(wry)
			It's good to see you, too.

					PICARD
			I've had a few... unpleasant
			surprises.
				(puts the phaser away)
			This isn't a good idea, Wil.
			Baran may get suspicious.

					RIKER
			As a matter of fact, Baran's the
			one who sent me here.
				(off his look)
			He told me to "wake you up," but
			he really wants me to "pretend" to
			get friendly with you and then
			help you organize a mutiny... so
			he can find your supporters among
			the crew and eliminate them.
				(beat)
			So here I am... pretending to like
			you after all.

	Picard can't help but smile a little at the irony of it
	all.

					PICARD
			Wheels within wheels... I'm
			starting to forget which side I'm
			on.
				(beat)
			All right... what have you found
			out so far?

					RIKER
			When we get to the Hyralan Sector,
			we're supposed to rendezvous with
			a Klingon transport ship. I'm not
			sure, but I think they might be
			delivering another Romulan
			artifact to us.

					PICARD
				(puzzled)
			A second artifact... ?
				(beat)
			By the way, these artifacts aren't
			Romulan... they're Vulcan.

					RIKER
			Vulcan?

18   CONTINUED: (2)

	Picard hands the PADD he was studying to Riker.

					PICARD
			I've been looking over the glyphs
			and pictograms I found on the
			Calder Two artifact. There's not
			enough data to translate the
			inscription, but the alphabet and
			symbology are more consistent with
			early Vulcan artifacts than
			Romulan.

					RIKER
			Do these artifacts have some kind
			of religious or cultural
			significance... something that
			would make them valuable enough to
			kill for?

					PICARD
			I don't know.
				(frustrated)
			If I could just get access to the
			Enterprise computer for even a few
			moments...

	Picard takes a few steps in the cramped room, trying to
	think. A long beat, then he starts to think in a
	different direction.

					PICARD
			What will Baran do once we obtain
			the second artifact?

					RIKER
			You're supposed to confirm it's
			authentic...
				(beat)
			... and then I'm supposed to kill
			you and take your place.

	They exchange a look.

					PICARD
				(dry)
			You always seem to be after my

	Riker smiles at the joke, then Picard gets serious
	again. He touches the device on the side of his neck.

					NARIK
			No. But they will follow

	Narik brushes past him and EXITS. Picard waits for a

			Who are you?

			What?

					TALLERA
			You're no smuggler... and I don't

	He tries to brush past her, but Tallera raises a phaser
	and points it directly at him.

					TALLERA
			You will tell me who you really

20   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - CARGO HOLD - CONTINUOUS

	As before.

					PICARD
			I don't know what you're talking
			about.

					TALLERA
			I will not play games with you.
			I found the message you sent to
			the Enterprise. When Riker used
			his command codes to drop their
			shields, you sent a transmission
			to them on the same carrier wave.
				(beat)
			You're a Starfleet officer.

	As Picard starts to protest --

					TALLERA
			Do not bother to deny it. It is
			the only... logical conclusion.

	She holds his gaze for another beat, then lowers the
	phaser and holsters it.

					TALLERA
				(continuing)
			My name is actually T'Paal... I am
			a member of the V'Shar.

					PICARD
				(shocked)
			Vulcan Security?

					TALLERA
			That is correct. I infiltrated
			this ship a year ago posing as a
			Romulan mercenary. I am here to
			investigate a possible threat to
			Vulcan.

					PICARD
			What sort of threat?

  STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT THREE  24.

20   CONTINUED:

					TALLERA
			First things first, Galen. Who
			are you?

	Picard thinks for a moment, then decides to take the
	plunge.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the
			Enterprise.

	Tallera nods... this confirms her thinking.

					TALLERA
			Very well. To answer your
			question, for several years, there
			has been a small, but growing
			movement of extreme isolationists
			on Vulcan... a group that believes
			contact with alien races has
			"polluted" our culture... and is
			destroying Vulcan purity.
				(beat)
			This group advocates the total
			isolation of Vulcan from the rest
			of the galaxy and the eradication
			of all alien influences from our
			planet.

					PICARD
			It sounds like a very... illogical
			philosophy.

					TALLERA
			Agreed. But extremists often have
			a logic all their own.

					PICARD
			What are these artifacts we're
			collecting? I know they're Vulcan
			in origin...

  STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/16/93 - ACT THREE  25.

20   CONTINUED: (2)

	Tallera looks away and her voice drops a little... this
	is a disturbing subject for her and it's not easy to
	talk about... there is even an element of shame in it.

					TALLERA
			I am sure you are familiar with
			the ancient history of my
			people... before we found
			logic... before we found peace.

					PICARD
			You were much like my people once
			were... a warlike, savage race...

					TALLERA
			There was even a time when we used
			our telepathic abilities as a
			weapon... a time when we learned
			to kill with a thought.

	That triggers something in Picard's memory.

					PICARD
			The Stone of Gol... ?

	Tallera looks at him, mildly surprised.

					TALLERA
			You know of it?

					PICARD
			I know the story from Vulcan
			mythology. According to the
			legend whoever possessed the stone
			needed only to think of throwing
			it at someone... and that person
			would be killed.

					TALLERA
			The Stone of Gol is real, but
			there is nothing magical or
			supernatural about it.

20   CONTINUED: (3)

					TALLERA (Cont'd)
				(beat)
			It is a psionic resonator... a
			device which focuses and amplifies
			telepathic energy. It is one of
			the most devastating weapons ever
			conceived.

					PICARD
			As I recall the legend, the Stone
			of Gol was destroyed by the gods
			when the Vulcan people found the
			way to peace...

					TALLERA
			The resonator was believed to have
			been destroyed during the Time of
			the Awakening. Only one piece was
			known to have survived and it was
			placed in a Vulcan museum under
			heavy guard.
				(beat)
			Six months ago, that piece was
			stolen from the museum. Soon
			after, mercenary ships began
			raiding archaeological sites
			across the quadrant. We believe
			that a member of the isolationist
			movement is trying to reassemble
			the resonator.

	Picard is disturbed by the implications.

					PICARD
			A telepathic weapon...

					TALLERA
			A Vulcan trained in the mental
			disciplines would be a formidable
			assassin. The entire Vulcan
			council could be killed with a
			single thought, and there would be
			no defense.
				(beat)
			My orders are to find that would-be
			assassin and stop him.

    STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT THREE    26A.

20   CONTINUED: (4)

					PICARD
			Since Baran will presumably need
			to deliver the artifacts to this
			assassin in order to get paid, it
			would seem that the best course of
			action is to continue with our
			little masquerade for now.

  STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT THREE  27.

20   CONTINUED: (5)

					TALLERA
			Agreed. But Captain... I cannot
			allow the resonator to be
			assembled. If necessary, I will
			destroy this ship, its crew... all
			of us... to prevent that from
			happening.

	Picard nods grimly in understanding.

			According to the terms of the

					WORF
			Yes, sir.

	Baran takes a couple of steps away and tries to
	think... he's very disturbed by this new development.

					BARAN
			The Enterprise...

	Picard throws Riker a suspicious look.

					PICARD
			How could they have found out
			about the rendezvous, Commander?

					RIKER
			How could I have known the

					PICARD
			Or maybe you're a clever liar.

					BARAN
			Quiet.

			All that matters now is that the

			in their possession.

					PICARD
			How can you be sure Koral had the
			piece when he was captured?

			The Klingon? He reported a

					PICARD
			You have a very bad sense of

					BARAN
				(ignoring him)
			They're not expecting an attack,
			so they won't have their shields
			up... we'll stay just outside
			visual range -- they can't pick us
			up on their long range sensors...
			and then we'll transport a raiding

					PICARD
			Do you have any idea how many
			security officers they have on a
			ship like that?

					BARAN
			No, I don't...
				(looks at Riker)
			... but he does.

	Riker thinks about this for a moment... then realizes
	that the best way to keep anyone from getting hurt on
	a raid like this is for him to lead it.

					RIKER
			I can get you aboard... and I can
			find that artifact.

					PICARD
				(sarcastic)
			Oh, how convenient... we'll just
			beam you aboard your old ship and
			then hope that you won't change

			I've already saved your life
			twice, Galen. I'd think you'd
			start to show a little gratitude

	Baran looks up and then Picard suddenly PUNCHES Baran
	right in the mouth, knocking him back off his feet.
	Everything on the Bridge comes to a stop as people turn
	to watch this turn of events. Picard faces the Bridge
	crew, his tone and bearing flushed with anger.

					PICARD
			Tell them what happened, Narik.

					NARIK
			Riker turned on us... he tried to
			kill Galen before we beamed back.

					PICARD
			He might have killed all of us.
			And I believe he was acting on the
			direct orders of Baran.
				(looks at Baran)
			You betrayed us.

	Baran gets back on his feet, rage flickering behind his
	eyes... but he warily glances around at the faces of
	his crew, trying to read their expressions -- who will
	they support? Picard rushes on, not giving Baran a
	chance to rebut him.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			I say this has gone on long
			enough. It's time for a new
			commander... someone who will
			lead us to the profits we've been
			promised.

					BARAN
			And who would that be? You,
			Galen?
				(to all)
			He's plotted this all along...
			opposed me at every turn...
			endangered all of us with his
			stubborn refusal to follow orders.

					PICARD
			A refusal to follow your orders...
			the orders of a small man trying
			to fill a role too big for him.

					BARAN
			I have kept this crew alive... I
			am about to bring us more profits
			than any of --

					PICARD
				(to all)
			More promises of riches. More
			excuses for Baran to fill his own
			coffers while the rest of us go
			begging. I say it's time for a
			change. Who's with me?

	A tense moment... then Tallera, Narik and two N.D.s
	move to stand with Picard. Vekor hesitates, then goes
	to Picard, along with one more N.D. Baran is alone...
	he can see the writing on the wall and he feels
	cornered.

					PICARD
				(quiet)
			It's over, Baran.

					BARAN
			Not quite.

	He pulls out the control device... everyone glances at
	it with a sense of apprehension. The device is Baran's
	trump card and they know it.

     STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - 08/06/93 - ACT FOUR     43.

30   CONTINUED: (3)

					BARAN
				(continuing)
			As long as I have this, I'm still
			in command.

					PICARD
			You can't kill us all... you need
			us to run the ship more than we
			need you to command it.

					BARAN
			I don't need to kill you all...
			just you, Galen. Somehow I think
			that watching you writhe in your
			death throes may change a few
			minds... and a few is all I need.

	He lifts the device, sets it to kill and prepares to
	press the button...

                                             FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

31   INT. MERCENARY BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	Continuous from Act Four. Baran presses the button on
	the control device and then suddenly Baran grabs his
	own neck in pain and drops to the floor, dead -- a
	stunned look on his face. Everyone is shocked except
	Picard, who moves to Baran's body and takes the control
	device out of his limp hand. Tallera moves to him.

					TALLERA
			What happened?

	Picard's expression is grim... he regrets this, but
	felt he had no choice.

					PICARD
			I switched our transponder codes.
			It seemed like a prudent, if
			regrettable step.

					TALLERA
			Baran was nothing. We have a
			mission to complete...
				(with meaning)
			... and the crew needs a leader.

	Picard turns away from Baran and faces the Bridge crew
	who are all looking to him. He looks down at the
	control device in his hand... then deliberately sets it
	on the deck, pulls his weapon and DESTROYS it with a
	phaser blast.

					PICARD
			There'll be no more "punishment"
			on this ship. Do your duties and
			I'll see to it that we complete
			our mission... and get our
			payment.

	A long beat as the crew looks at him... they glance at
	each other... then finally return to their places on
	the Bridge. Tallera picks up the artifact from where
	Baran dropped it.

					TALLERA
				(to Narik, re: Baran's
				 body)
			Remove that.

	Narik begins dragging Baran's body off the Bridge.

			Aye... Captain.

	It's been a while since anyone called Picard that and
	he can't help but smile a little at the irony... then

					SATOK
			Greetings, Commander. How may I

					RIKER
			Minister, I wanted to let you know

			Vulcan right now.

					SATOK
			I do not understand.

33   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			I'm sorry. It's been a difficult
			couple of days.
				(beat)
			I know that one of your operatives
			has been investigating the
			assembly of the psionic resonator
			on a mercenary ship for several
			months. I didn't want someone to
			make a mistake and start firing at
			them when they approach your
			planet.

	A long beat as Satok thinks. He looks at Riker with a
	puzzled expression.

					SATOK
			Commander, I believe there is a
			problem.
				(beat)
			We have no operative aboard a
			mercenary ship.

	Riker looks blankly at the screen for a moment... then
	he starts to realize. OFF Riker's shocked reaction...

34   INT. BARAN'S QUARTERS

	Picard and Tallera are at the computer console which

	The two pieces of the resonator are sitting on a nearby
	table.

					PICARD
				(off monitor)
			According to Baran's logs, the two
			artifacts are supposed to be
			delivered... to the T'Karath
			Sanctuary on Vulcan.

					TALLERA
			I know that place. It was an
			underground stronghold for one of
			the factions during the last civil
			war. It's been abandoned for
			centuries.

	Picard hits his combadge.

34   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(to com)
			Galen to Bridge. Alter course for
			Vulcan.

					VEKOR'S COM VOICE
			Understood.

	Picard sits back and his gaze is drawn to the two
	pieces of the resonator on the table. His curiosity is
	piqued and he carefully examines them...

					PICARD
				(to Tallera)
			Perhaps you can help me with
			something... I've been able to
			translate most of the writing on
			these pieces...

34A  INSERT - ON RESONATOR PIECES

	Picard picks up the two pieces together and runs his
	fingers over the intricate inscriptions.

					PICARD'S VOICE
			For the most part, they're just
			warnings of death and destruction
			for those who oppose the
			resonator...

34B  RESUME SCENE

	As before. Picard turns the large piece over and shows
	Tallera the bottom of the base piece.

					PICARD
			But this hieroglyph on the
			anterior has me a bit puzzled.

34C  INSERT - ON BASE PIECE

	The bottom of the base has TWO large SYMBOLS -- one an
	intricate series of circles and lines, the other a more
	abstract drawing of heroic Vulcan figure. There is a
	large NOTCH missing from the base at the point where
	the third piece is supposed to fit into it. PART of a
	jagged LINE borders the area of the missing piece --
	it's incomplete, suggesting yet another symbol on the
	other piece.

       STAR TREK: "Gambit, Part II" - REV. 08/10/93 - ACT FIVE      48.

34C  CONTINUED:

					PICARD'S VOICE
			This is clearly the Vulcan god of
			war... and this is the god of
			death...

34D  RESUME SCENE

	Picard indicates the point where the missing piece
	would fit.

					PICARD
			But if you look closely you can
			see that there is a third symbol
			missing -- which should be on the
			final piece. The odd thing is
			that typically, the gods of war
			and death would stand alone on an
			artifact... they would never be
			combined with a third glyph.

	Tallera looks it over for a moment.

					TALLERA
			Fascinating. But I am not an
			archaeological expert.

					PICARD
			Hmmmm. I'm anxious to see the
			final artifact... it may provide
			a new insight into Vulcan
			mythology.

	Picard continues to look at the pieces. Tallera brings
	them back to the business at hand.

					TALLERA
			When we arrive at Vulcan, I will
			take these pieces to a secure
			holding area before going to the
			Sanctuary. I prefer to go
			alone... it will arouse less
			suspicion among the isolationists.

					PICARD
				(nods agreement)
			We shouldn't have any problems
			entering orbit.
					(MORE)

34D  CONTINUED:

					PICARD (Cont'd)
			I told Commander Riker to contact
			the Vulcan authorities from the
			Enterprise and warn them of our
			approach.

	Tallera is caught off-guard by this and her face
	momentarily registers surprise.

					PICARD
				(off her reaction)
			I didn't want to risk a
			misunderstanding... someone might
			have mistaken this for an actual
			raid...

	Picard trails off... he saw the quick look of shock on
	Tallera's face... he's beginning to feel that something
	is definitely not right here.

					TALLERA
				(covering)
			It was a wise precaution.

	A beat. Picard's suspicions have been raised by this
	quick look of surprise... he begins to probe around a
	bit, watching her reactions carefully.

					PICARD
			Perhaps I should contact the
			Enterprise... have them meet us
			at Vulcan in case these
			isolationists try to escape.

					TALLERA
			Your offer is appreciated... but
			our security forces are more than
			adequate.

					PICARD
			I see.
				(beat)
			Are you sure it's wise for you to
			go to the Sanctuary alone? After
			all, they're expecting Baran to
			show up, not you. If I
			accompanied you, it may seem more
			plausible that --

34D  CONTINUED: (2)

					TALLERA
			Captain, I understand your human
			emotional need to be there at the
			final moment... but this is a
			Vulcan matter.

	Tallera has given him perfectly valid answers to all
	his questions... he smiles in agreement, but there is
	still something bothering him at the back of his mind.

					PICARD
			Of course.

					TALLERA
			Thank you.

	She picks up the two pieces of the resonator and EXITS.
	Picard looks after her for a moment... then follows.

	Vulcan.

36   INT. MERCENARY SHIP - BRIDGE

	Picard in command, Tallera, Vekor, and Narik at their
	stations.

					VEKOR
			We have entered orbit of Vulcan.

	Tallera takes the two pieces of the resonator and moves
	toward the transporter pad. But Picard stops her.

					PICARD
			Tallera... I've decided on a
			change of plan. Leave one
			artifact here for now. Take the
			other... and once we have our
			payment in hand, we'll complete
			the delivery.

	Tallera looks at him, trying to gauge what he's up to.
	This is a delicate game being played out in full view
	of the mercenary crew.

					TALLERA
			That was not the agreement.

					PICARD
			I realize that. But it would be
			safer for all concerned if we kept
			one piece here.

					TALLERA
			They will not pay us until they
			get both pieces.

					PICARD
			They've waited a long time for
			this. They won't take any risks
			at this stage. Take the piece and
			beam down.

	Tallera holds his gaze for a moment. After a beat, she
	decides on a bolder move. She moves to him,
	confronting Picard directly. Again her words are meant
	for the benefit of the crew, who are watching them both
	closely.

					TALLERA
			That is all I was waiting for.

36   CONTINUED:

	She turns and faces the rest of the crew.

					TALLERA
				(to Vekor)
			Go to the navigational computer
			and check file one-three-seven-slash-omega.
			You'll find a
			message secretly transmitted to
			the Enterprise, containing our
			entire flight plan.

	There are shocked reactions around the Bridge. Vekor
	goes to the navigational console and works for a
	moment. Picard knows she has him dead to rights and he
	can't deny it.

					VEKOR
				(shocked, off monitor)
			She's right.

					TALLERA
			That message was sent by Galen...
			he's a Starfleet officer.

	The crew reacts with dismay. Narik grabs a phaser and
	points it at Picard.

					NARIK
				(to Tallera)
			Why didn't you tell us before?

					TALLERA
			I wasn't sure until he tried to
			stop me from taking the artifacts
			to the surface. Then I knew he
			was intentionally obstructing our
			plans to keep us from being paid.

	Picard's mind races... looking for a counter move.

					PICARD
			Tallera's right, I am a Starfleet
			officer... but what she's not
			telling you is that those
			artifacts in her hand are part of
			an incredibly powerful weapon.
			There's no reward waiting for you
			down on the surface. Tallera will
			take the artifacts and leave you
			here, to be captured by Starfleet.

	Everyone looks at Tallera, who has to think fast. She
	looks at them.

					TALLERA
			I've served on this ship for
			almost a year now... fought by
			your sides... protected you from
			Baran when I could... and now I've
			exposed a spy in our midst.
				(beat)
			I think I've proven my loyalty.

					PICARD
				(to others)
			You know Tallera... you know she's
			a woman of great patience. She's
			bided her time and waited for this
			moment. All she cares about is
			assembling that weapon. If she
			leaves this ship you'll never see
			her again.

	There's a beat as they consider this.

					VEKOR
				(to Tallera)
			I don't care what it is you want,
			Tallera. I don't care if that's
			a weapon for your private use or
			if you're really just making a
			delivery as planned. All I care
			about is my money.
				(beat)
			So I propose a compromise. Narik
			and I will go with you to the
			surface to guarantee we receive
			payment. After that, you can go
			wherever you want.

					TALLERA
			Agreed.
				(re: Picard)
			Bring him as well. We can use him
			as a hostage if Starfleet
			arrives... if not we'll kill him
			on the surface.

	Picard has little choice in the matter as Narik nods
	and roughly shoves him toward the pad.

37   INT. VULCAN CAVERN (OPTICAL)

	This used to be a hideaway for Vulcan soldiers over two
	thousand years ago -- think of the catacombs where
	Christians used to hide from the Romans. The cavern
	itself is dark and gloomy, and there are remnants of
	decaying Vulcan artifacts lying around... some cracked
	and peeling glyphs on the walls... a very old and dusty
	place. A crude stone altar dominates the room. In
	front of the altar is a modern storage CONTAINER.

	Tallera, Vekor, Narik, and Picard MATERIALIZE next to
	the altar and look around. Tallera indicates the
	storage container.

					TALLERA
			There. Your reward as promised.

	Vekor heads for the storage container while Narik
	guards Picard. Tallera moves to the altar and picks up
	the third piece of the resonator and begins to link it
	to the other two.

37A  ON PICARD

	as he reacts to something with puzzlement...

37B  POV PICARD - CLOSE ON THIRD PIECE

	The underside of the third piece has a unique Vulcan
	symbol on it. As Tallera assembles the resonator, this
	symbol falls neatly into place with the other two
	symbols we have seen earlier.

37C  RESUME SCENE

	as Vekor OPENS the storage container and examines the
	bars of gold-pressed latinum within.

					NARIK
			Is it all there?

					VEKOR
			No. This is less than half of
			what we were promised.
				(to Tallera)
			Where is the rest of it?

	Tallera never takes her eyes off the resonator -- it's
	fully assembled now.

			That is all I could manage. I

	Tallera turns to him and a DISSONANT CHORD can be heard
	in the room... it quickly increases in volume and there
	is a sense of growing power in the room.

					TALLERA
			Very well. You will get what you
			deserve.

38   ON NARIK (OPTICAL)

	As a DISTORTION suddenly appears in the air in front of
	him... he gives it a puzzled look for a moment, and
	then a LOUD CRACKLE of energy BLOWS him backwards
	across the cavern as if by an unseen hand... he falls
	to the floor, dead.

39   VEKOR (OPTICAL)

	Reacts to Narik's death and points her phaser at
	Tallera, but she's too late -- the DISTORTION appears
	in front of her and then Vekor is also killed.

40   WIDER

	As Picard faces Tallera alone in the silent cavern.
	His eyes automatically drop to one of the phasers lying
	nearby on the ground -- but it will do him little good
	in these circumstances.

					TALLERA
			Go ahead, Captain. Pick up the
			phaser. See what good it will do.

					PICARD
			You can't win, Tallera. Starfleet
			won't stand by while you tear
			apart one of the founding worlds
			of the Federation.

					TALLERA
			How little you understand what you
			are facing, Captain.

	She takes a few steps toward him... a cat toying with
	her prey.

				(beat)
			Pick up the phaser, Captain.

	A tense beat... then suddenly:

41   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	As Riker, Worf, and TWO N.D. SECURITY GUARDS
	MATERIALIZE in the cavern. Tallera whirls around to
	deal with this new threat, but Picard makes a sudden
	realization and shouts to his officers...

					PICARD
			Drop your weapons! Do it!

	Riker and the others respond instinctively to Picard's
	command and they drop their weapons.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Make no aggressive movements. The
			resonator amplifys violent
			thoughts and emotions.

	The officers do as they're told. Tallera concentrates
	on them and the DISSONANT CHORD is heard building in
	the room.

					PICARD
				(to Tallera)
			That's why you wanted me to take
			the phaser -- and why you were
			able to kill Narik and Vekor. It
			wasn't until I saw the image on
			the last artifact... that I
			realized what the message on the
			resonator was.

			The third image is the Vulcan

42   ON RIKER (OPTICAL)

	As the DISTORTION forms in front of him. He steels
	himself... tries to ignore it... closes his eyes...
	and then the distortion PASSES DIRECTLY THROUGH HIM
	without harm.

43   TALLERA

	Reacts... the effort tired her.

					TALLERA
				(shocked)
			No...

					PICARD
			Think, Tallera -- two thousand
			years ago, your people were being
			consumed by war... then they found
			the way of peace and logic.
			During the same period, the
			resonator was dismantled... don't
			you see the connection?
				(beat)
			When peace came to Vulcan, the
			resonator became useless. That is
			why it was dismantled.

	Tallera summons her strength and tries one more time.

44   WORF (OPTICAL)

			You were right... the resonator
			cannot be stopped with phasers or

			form of violence... it can be
			stopped with peace.

	Tallera glares up at him... makes one final effort...
	but the DISSONANT CHORD only briefly grows in volume...
	then fades away completely. Tallera drops the
	resonator to the ground.

	Picard quietly moves to the resonator... picks it up...
	and carefully removes the pieces. It's finally over.

	Picard, Riker and Data are walking through the

			It is unfortunate that it cannot

					RIKER
			What's going to happen to the
			mercenaries?

					PICARD
			They have been detained by the
			Vulcan authorities, for the
			moment.

			But they're also facing charges
			from the Klingons, the
			Cardassians, the Ferengi, and
			about seven other worlds. We
			won't be hearing from them for
			quite some time.

	They stop outside Picard's quarters.

					PICARD
			Number One, set course for
			Starbase two-twenty-seven. I'll
			be on the Bridge shortly.

					RIKER
				(with humor)
			Wait a minute... You were declared
			dead, remember? You can't give
			orders around here.

	Picard smiles at the joke, but Data misses the humor
	and thinks for a moment.

					DATA
				(to Riker)
			If we are to adhere to the exact
			letter of Starfleet regulations,
			then technically sir, you have
			been declared a renegade. In
			fact, I believe you are facing
			twelve counts of court martial
			offenses. You cannot give orders
			either.

	Picard is quick to jump on this.

					PICARD
				(to Data)
			Quite right. I'm going to get
			some sleep. In the meantime I
			suggest you escort Commander Riker
			to the brig.

					DATA
			Yes, sir.

	Picard EXITS to his quarters and Data takes Riker by
	the arm.

					DATA
			This way, sir...

					RIKER
			Data, he was just joking... you
			know that, right? Data?

	As they head off down the Corridor...

                                             FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT FIVE
