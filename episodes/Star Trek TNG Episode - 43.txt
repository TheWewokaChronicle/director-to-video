	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit around a planet.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, Stardate 42881.5.
			We are in orbit around Antede
			Three, awaiting the arrival of
			two dignitaries from this world.

2    INT. CORRIDOR - ON PICARD

	walking toward us, wearing a full-dress uniform.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			Our mission is to carry them to
			a conference on planet Pacifica...

3    TRANSPORTER ROOM - PICARD (OPTICAL)

	as he the Transporter Room with DOCTOR PULASKI, WESLEY
	and WORF, all of whom wear work uniforms.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			... where their race will be given
			the opportunity to join the
			Federation.

					PICARD
			I thought you might find this
			interesting, Mister Crusher. Few
			humans have ever seen an Antedian
			in the flesh.

	Picard nods at TRANSPORTER CHIEF O'BRIEN who begins
	the energizing process. The two delegates begin to
	MATERIZLIZE on the platform...

           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           2.

4    REVERSE ANGLE ON ANTEDIANS

	as seen from behind. They are dressed in flowing, red
	robe-like garments with an attached hood which keeps
	us from seeing their heads from here.

					PICARD
			Welcome. I'm Jean-Luc Picard,
			captain of the Enterprise.

					WESLEY
				(hesitates, then)
			Are they alright, Captain?

	Doctor Pulaski moves toward them with a medical instrument
	in hand. She grimaces as she gets near their faces.

					PICARD
			No, this is their preferred way
			of space travel.

5    ANGLE TO INCLUDE THE ANTEDIANS

	seen from the front for the first time. It is not a
	pretty sight. Each mottled face resembles an oversized
	catfish: huge gaping mouth, spindly whiskers, big fish
	eyes, and a skeletal structure that gives them a
	grotesque, unhealthy appearance. Their hooded, crimson
	robes only emphasize their eerie, menacing appearance.
	But what is really bizarre is that they're completely
	motionless -- catatonic. A medium-sized container
	arrives with them.

	Pulaski methodically runs her medical instruments along
	the Antedian's necks.

					PULASKI
			Their physical condition appears
			good enough, considering the
			circumstances.

					PICARD
				(to Welsey)
			It is a self-induced catatonic
			state. Their way of dealing with
			the trauma of spaceflight.

					WESLEY
			Will we try to revive them?

           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           3.

5    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Not until we reach the Pacifica
			conference. It's three days away.
				(to Pulaski)
			You've prepared Sickbay facilities
			for holding them, Doctor?

					PULASKI
			As soon as we make some
			adjustments. Their physiology
			is unusual.
				(to O'Brien)
			Can you store them for a few
			hours?

					O'BRIEN
			Aye. I'll have them kept out of
			the way here.

					WESLEY
			What's in this container?

					PULASKI
			Their food. When they come out
			of stasis, they will be very
			hungry.

5A   ANOTHER ANGLE

	Wesley steps over to the container and lifts the cover.
	It's filled with a writhing, squirming mass of
	worm-like creatures.

					WESLEY
			This is what they eat?

					PULASKI
			In great quantities.

5B   SCENE

					PICARD
				(to Worf)
			Provide security.

					WORF
			Understood, sir.

	Worf steps forward and looks at the Antedians
	admiringly.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER          3A.

5B   CONTINUED:

					WORF
				(continuing)
			What a handsome race.

	The others look at Worf, wondering if he could possibly
	be serious. And of course, he is.

5C   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	as she leaves orbit.

6    INT. BRIDGE

	The normal bridge crew are in their positions. Troi
	is also there.

					RIKER
			What did you think of the
			Antedians, Wesley?

					WESLEY
			Well, they are rather
			strange-looking, Commander.

	Picard ENTERS and walks to his position.

           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           4.

6    CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Judging a being by its physical
			appearance is the last great human
			prejudice, Wesley.

					PICARD
			A point well taken. I'm sure
			that to the Antedians, we're
			equally unattractive.

					RIKER
			It is interesting to consider just
			how subjective "beauty" truly
			is...

					WORF
			Captain... we're being hailed by
			a small transport vessel just
			coming into range.

7    ANGLE EMPHASIZING TROI

	As she suddenly stiffens.

					TROI
			Oh, my God!

					PICARD
			What is the problem?

					TROI
			What can she be doing here?

					WESLEY
			On the screen, Captain.

8    ANGLE INCLUDING MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	where the pilot of the shuttle is seen. He appears
	to be a bit weary and nervous.

					TRANSPORT PILOT
			Starship Enterprise, come in!

					RIKER
			We have you on our viewer, Pilot.

           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           5.

8    CONTINUED:

					TRANSPORT PILOT
			Enterprise... I have a passenger
			-- a V.I.P. passenger -- who I'm
			ordered to --

					MRS. TROI (V.O.)
			Let me talk to them, Pilot. I'm
			much more articulate.

	The transport pilot seems relieved to step aside and
	let the woman speak for herself.

9    MOVE IN ON THE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as MRS. TROI slides into the picture.

					TROI
			Mother!

					DATA
			Captain, we are now receiving
			Starfleet orders granting a
			Lwaxana....

					MRS. TROI
				(overlapping)
			Lwaxana Troi, daughter of the
			Fifth House, Holder of the Sacred
			Chalice of Riix, heir to the Holy
			Rings of Betazed.

					DATA
			... full ambassadorial status,
			sir.

					RIKER
			I'm afraid it's back into your
			formal uniform, Captain.

					DATA
			And yours too, Commander. She
			is listed as representing the
			Betazed government at the
			conference.

					TROI
			Mother, please don't do this to
			me.

           STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - TEASER           6.

9    CONTINUED:

					MRS. TROI
			Do what to you, Little One?
				(to Picard)
			Oh, what naughty thoughts,
			Jean-Luc. How wonderful you still
			think of me in that way.

10   ANGLE EMPHASIZING PICARD AND RIKER

	looking at one another resignedly, preparing for the
	worst.

									FADE OUT.

                         END OF TEASER                          

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          7.

                            ACT ONE                             

	FADE IN:

11   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - PICARD, RIKER AND TROI

	as they ENTER, Picard and Riker now in formal full
	dress. The Antedians, still catatonic, have been moved
	to the side where a SECURITY GUARD stands with them.

					TROI
			It's so like my mother to do the
			unexpected. She's famous for it.

					PICARD
			It will be nice to have her as
			a guest of the Enterprise again.

	Riker exchanges a look with Picard signifying some
	reservations. Picard turns to Transporter Chief
	O'Brien.

					PICARD
			Energize.

12   ANGLE ON THE TRANSPORTER PLATFORM (OPTICAL)

	as Mrs. Troi beams in. She is apparently kneeling on
	the platform, hunched over and facing backwards...

13   CLOSE ON MRS. TROI

					MRS. TROI
				(opening her eyes)
			Aaagh! Where are my legs?!

					TROI
			Where they belong, Mother, Right
			under you.

	Mrs. Troi begins standing up.

					MRS. TROI
				(offhand)
			Oh, wonderful. So they are!
				(turning to Picard)
			But I'll never completely trust
			this device, Jean-Luc...

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          8.

13   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			He's "Captain Picard," Mother...

	Mrs. Troi has turned to where she suddenly sees the
	"frozen" Antedians.

					MRS. TROI
			Aaagh!

					PICARD
				(to Riker, resignedly)
			Explain.

					RIKER
			Sorry they startled you, Mrs.
			Troi. These are Antedian
			delegates... ah, temporarily being
			stored here, I believe...

					MRS. TROI
			"Delegates?" The last time I saw
			something like this, it was being
			served on a plate.

	Picard has to turn away to hide his smile at this. But
	Riker enjoys it openly, especially her next line.

					MRS. TROI
				(continuing)
			But you, Jean-Luc, I was not aware
			you had such handsome legs. My
			valet is waiting. You may beam
			him aboard now.

	Picard nods at the Chief O'Brien and in a second, a
	larger figure MATERIALIZES. MISTER HOMN arrives carrying
	Mrs. Troi's "suitcase". He breaks into that easy,
	enigmatic smile of his as he looks around the room.

					MRS. TROI
			You remember Mister Homn, of course.

					PICARD
			It would be hard to forget Mister
			Homn. Welcome back to the
			Enterprise.

	Homn nods toward Picard.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          9.

13   CONTINUED: (2)

					MRS. TROI
			I've retained his services despite
			the outlandishly lustful thoughts
			he spews in my direction. I
			suppose the poor fellow just can't
			help himself.

	It's hard to believe Homn would lust after anyone.

					MRS. TROI
				(continuing; to Picard)
			Perhaps you could show me to my
			suite now?

					PICARD
			Certainly.

	Mister Homn starts to pick up her luggage...

					MRS. TROI
			Put that down, Homn. We can't
			deny the captain the honor of
			carrying my belongings.

	Picard looks at the beehive-shaped carrying-case. He
	remembers the last time...

					PICARD
			I won't interfere with Homn's
			duties this time.

					MRS. TROI
			That's not the real reason,
			Jean-Luc. You forget I'm a
			telepath.

	Picard looks from Mrs. Troi to Deanna as Homn picks
	up the luggage...

					RIKER
			Look, since this apparently has
			some meaning to you, Mrs. Troi,
			I'll...

	Riker reaches in to take the luggage from Homn.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			...carry...it.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          10.

13   CONTINUED: (3)

	Homn has released the luggage and the full weight of
	it (with a MUFFLED CLANKING SOUND) is taken by Riker,
	whose words have come out in a surprised GROAN.

14   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR

	The others follow Riker who is trying his best to
	"casually" carry the heavy bag down the hallway.
	Picard, the Trois and Homn follow closely behind.

					RIKER
				(trying not to sound
				 labored)
			It's... just down this hall.

15   EMPHASIZING THE TROI WOMEN

	Deanna is glaring at her mother who is looking at
	Riker's legs.

					MRS. TROI
				(telepathic)
			He has nice legs too, Little One.
			Is he still yours?

					TROI
				(telepathic)
			Humans no longer own each other
			that way, Mother.

					MRS. TROI
			Oh really?
				(looks at Picard)
			That's a custom we may have to
			introduce again.

16   INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS - PICARD (OPTICAL)

	as the Group ENTERS and Riker puts down the baggage,
	SIGHS with relief.

					MRS. TROI
			Thank you.

					RIKER
			Glad I could help out.

	Riker and the others EXIT, leaving Picard to face Mrs.
	Troi alone.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          11.

16   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			I trust you'll be comfortable
			here, Mrs. Troi. Now if you'll
			excuse me, I must get back to my
			duties.

					MRS. TROI
			Captain, I will be serving a
			Betazoid dinner of greeting
			tonight. It is an ambassadorial
			function.

					PICARD
				(after a hesitation)
			Of course. It, uh, sounds
			delightful.

	Picard EXITS. Mrs. Troi speaks of him as she flutters
	about, checking out the intricacies of her quarters...

					MRS. TROI
			He's a fine man. Solid. Earnest.
			Reliable. Perhaps a little on
			the dull side, but all in all he's
			not bad.

					TROI
			I cannot believe you! You sound
			like you're sizing up a commodity.

					MRS. TROI
			But that's exactly what men are,
			darling. Especially human men.
				(chuckles, strokes
				 Deanna's face)
			Was your father ever unhappy with
			me?

					TROI
			No, he worshipped you, Mother.
			But I'll never learn to see men
			the way you do.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          12.

16   CONTINUED: (2)

					MRS. TROI
			You will as you mature, darling.
			And the males in your life will
			bless you for it.

17   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - RIKER, WESLEY, WORF, DATA

	Most of them are LAUGHING, except Data who is smiling
	slightly. Even Worf seems almost amused.

					WESLEY
			... but it's true she complimented
			Captain Picard on his legs?

	Riker nods affirmative.

					DATA
			I would have thought a telepath
			would be more discreet.

					RIKER
			No, it's just the opposite. She
			knows what's in your mind and she
			lets you know what's on hers.

	More LAUGHTER -- which is suddenly stilled as they
	realize that Picard ENTERED the bridge. Picard takes
	his seat at command and speaks in a tone that's polite,
	yet gets the point across -- enough of this
	conversation.

					PICARD
			We must not lose sight of the fact
			that we're talking about someone
			who has been granted ambassadorial
			rank. Even if she appears a bit
			eccentric, Lwaxana Troi must be
			treated with appropriate respect.
			Is that understood?

	The others make it clear that it is.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          13.

17   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			Our orders on her mentioned
			nothing specific except...

					PICARD
				(waits)
			Except what, Mister Data?

					DATA
			We are to cooperate with her as
			fully as possible, deliver her
			there untroubled, rested...
				(seeing Picard's
				 expression)
			I assume those were merely
			courtesies due her rank, sir.

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			See that every bridge officer and
			supervisor has the full text of
			that transmission.

					RIKER
			Aye, sir.

18   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE IN WARP TRAVEL (OPTICAL)

19   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - FAVORING PICARD

					PICARD
			Picard to Pulaski. When was the
			last time you looked in on our
			Antedian guests?

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          14.

20   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - CLOSE ON PULASKI

	intently concentrating on reexamining the Antedians.

					PULASKI
			I'm doing so right now, Captain.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Are they still catatonic?

					PULASKI
			Status of the beings is unchanged.
			Pulse still steady -- respiration
			normal for them.

21   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - SAME SETTING

					PICARD
			Understood. Keep me informed --
			Picard out.

	Picard leans back in his chair, takes a deep breath,
	and then rises.

					PICARD
			I believe I'll get some rest.
				(exiting; to Riker)
			It will be a dress uniform dinner,
			gentlemen.

					RIKER
			Sir?

	But PICARD EXITS.

					DATA
			Inquiry, Commander: to which
			dinner was the captain referring?

	Riker ponders the question.

					RIKER
			Nothing I've been invited to.
			Have any of you?

	Apparently no one has.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			Very interesting!

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT ONE          15.

22   EXT. THE ENTERPRISE - FLYING BY AT WARP SPEED (OPTICAL)

23   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - PICARD

	(back in formal dress) walks down the hallway with a
	bottle of ice-blue Altairian brandy in his right hand.
	As he rounds a corner he comes face to face with Doctor
	Pulaski, going the other way.

					PICARD
			You're not attending the dinner
			with us this evening, Doctor?

					PULASKI
			I've already eaten, Captain. But
			thanks anyway.

	We HEAR A CHIME.

					MRS. TROI (V.O.)
				(sing-song)
			Come in!

	The expression on Pulaski's face is interesting.

24   INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS - PICARD

	ENTERS to find romantic lighting, with candle-like
	objects spread about the room, and a small table made
	up for two. Mrs. Troi is out of sight in an adjoining
	room; Mister Homn is filling expensive-looking glasses
	with what looks like wine.

	Picard holds out the bottle -- Homn accepts it... and
	then to Picard's surprise, he unscrews the top and
	begins to drink straight from the bottle. Picard
	starts to say something, but thinks better of it. In
	a matter of moments, Homn drains the entire bottle!

	The giant smiles at Picard and bows regally -- his way
	of saying thanks.

					PICARD
			Tell me Mister Homn, when will the
			others be arriving?

	Homn stares back blankly.

			The other officers?

			Commander Riker? Deanna?

	Homn shakes his head from side to side and smiles
	mischievously. He points a long finger at Picard and
	then points behind the Captain. Picard turns to see...

25   MRS. TROI

	leaning against the wall, wearing a sexy dress and a
	provocative look.

					MRS. TROI
				(purring)
			Hello, Jean-Luc. So glad you

26   MOVE IN ON THE CAPTAIN

	this is not what he expected...

27   INT. MRS TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	Mrs. Troi and the captain are seated at the little
	table, about to begin their meal. Their glasses are
	full and Homn is serving them a colorful Betazoid
	salad.

					MRS. TROI
				(raising glass)
			A toast: to Earthmen... who
			despite their faults, have a
			unique ability to charm women of
			all races, in all corners of the
			galaxy.

					PICARD
				(clinks glass)
			Speaking for the men of Earth,
			which is an awesome responsibility
			indeed, I thank you.

	Picard is attempting to be light and uncaring, but
	underneath the surface, this candlelight dinner is
	making him uncomfortable.

					MRS. TROI
				(teasing, flirting)
			I know what you're thinking,
			Captain.

					PICARD
				(a bit worried)
			You do?

					MRS. TROI
			You're wondering if I've been
			seeing any other man on a serious
			basis.

					PICARD
				(shaking head)
			Well actually I wasn't --

					MRS. TROI
			-- I wouldn't worry about it,
			Jean-Luc.

					MRS. TROI (Cont'd)
				(reaches out, touches
				 his hand)
			Competition seems to bring out
			the best in the human male.

	Picard smiles weakly and subtly withdraws his hand to
	lift his glass to his lips.

					PICARD
			I must admit, I wasn't expecting
			this... setting. I assumed that
			my high-ranking officers would
			also be attending.

					MRS. TROI
			Never assume anything when it
			comes to Lwaxana Troi. A Betazoid
			woman is full of surprises.

	Not knowing just what to say, Picard begins to pick at
	his food, but Mrs. Troi seems to be waiting for
	something. Behind her, Mister Homn, sipping a drink, has
	just taken his place next to a big, circular chime near
	the far wall.

					MRS. TROI
				(continuing)
			Strange, I'm not that hungry
			tonight.
				(leans forward, coy)
			I wonder what's making me lose
			my appetite? Any ideas?

	She smiles and extends a utensil toward her blue salad.
	Homn downs his drink and makes ready. She takes a
	bite, Homn STRIKES THE CHIME. Picard jumps at the
	SOUND.

					PICARD
			Oh yes, you're giving thanks for
			your food. I'd forgotten about
			that.
				(pause)
			I wonder how many other cultures
			have similar customs.

					MRS. TROI
			I don't know.

30A  INT. BRIDGE - SCIENCE ONE - DATA (INTERCUT AS NEEEDED)

					DATA
			Yes, Captain.

					PICARD
			Mrs. Troi and I are having a very
			interesting discussion about the
			various ways by which societies
			give thanks. For instance, the
			Betazoids use of the chime.

					DATA
			The use of the chime is unique,
			but not at all dissimilar to the
			Ooolans of Marejaretus Six, who
			use two large stones which are
			continuously struck during the
			meal. Those at the dinner must
			eat until the stones are broken.
			Or, the oligarchy on Atifs Four,
			which require a young male to...

					PICARD
				(overlapping)
			Commander, this is absolutely
			fascinating, don't you agree, Mrs.
			Troi? Data, if your duties
			permit, why don't you join us for
			dessert?

					DATA
			You are forgetting sir -- I do not
			digest foodstuffs, therefore I
			cannot participate in the
			consumption of your post-main
			course edibles.

					MRS. TROI
			What'd he just say?

         STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO         19A.

30A  CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			You don't have to eat to join us,
			Commander. I'm sure Mrs. Troi
			would simply enjoy the pleasure
			of your company.

	Data is pleased to hear it...

					DATA
			Indeed, sir. I am on my way; Data
			out.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO          20.

30A  CONTINUED: (2)

					MRS. TROI
				(annoyed)
			How could you possibly think I'd
			want to share our special time
			together, with that robot of
			yours?

					PICARD
			Because... because of his
			wonderful after-dinner
			conversation. His anecdotes are
			the stuff of legends aboard this
			ship.

									CUT TO:

31   INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	CLOSE on Data, now sitting at their table, eagerly
	concluding an "anecdote".

					DATA
			-- So by using the square root
			of pi and then multiplying it by
			nine to the third power, I was
			able to accurately calculate the
			distance between the Omicron
			galaxy and the Crab Nebula.

32   PULL BACK TO INCLUDE PICARD AND MRS TROI (OPTICAL)

	She is literally bored stiff by Data's stories. In
	the b.g. we see Mister Homn break into a slow, cat-like
	yawn.

					PICARD
			Fascinating, Data. I'm sure Mrs.
			Troi would love to hear the one
			about the, uh, anomalous chemical
			composition of... say... brown
			dwarf stars.

					MRS. TROI
			Well, not really --

					DATA
				(enthused)
			-- Yes Captain, that is a
			particularly spellbinding subject.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO          21.

32   CONTINUED:

	Data turns to Mrs. Troi with a pleased, eager look on
	his face.

					DATA
				(continuing)
			For most stars, the rare-Earth
			element Europium is enriched
			relative to samarium and
			gadolinium...

					MRS. TROI
				(flat, bored)
			Is that so?

					DATA
			It is! However in brown dwarf
			stars, the element Europium is
			anomalously depleted.

					MRS. TROI
				(sarcastic)
			Fascinating.

					DATA
			But that is only the beginning.
			If the abundances of the elements
			terbium, dysprosium, holmium and
			erbium are also factored into the
			analysis...

33   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - TROI AND PULASKI

	are walking together.

					PULASKI
			Your mother seems quite an
			interesting woman, Deanna.

					TROI
			Doctor, perhaps I should tell you
			something about my mother's
			condition at this time.

					PULASKI
			Condition at this time?!

					TROI
			Something that occurs to Betazoid
			females at mid-life. We call it
			the Phase.

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO          22.

33   CONTINUED:

					PULASKI
			At mid-life as in the human
			female's menopause?

					TROI
				(laughing)
			Almost the exact opposite. It
			is only at mid-life that Betazed
			females become... well, fully
			sexual, if you know what I mean.

					PULASKI
			Yes, perhaps I do. I just heard
			her voice fairly singing when she
			called the captain into her room.

					TROI
			I wonder if I shouldn't warn the
			captain?

	Pulaski considers it. Is there a gleam of amusement
	in her eyes?

					PULASKI
			Nooo. As ship's doctor I'd
			consider it excellent exercise
			for his reflexes and agility.

					TROI
				(somewhat shocked)
			Doctor... !

					PULASKI
			In staying ahead of your mother.

	Troi suddenly understands, smiling.

					TROI
			Yes. An animal is always at its
			best when hunted...

					PULASKI
			Or when hunting.

34   STAY ON DEANNA

	as she walks on, turns and ENTERS her mother's
	quarters...

	has activated a computer screen and is now pointing
	out various moving objects, as Deanna ENTERS...

			... and at this point, the second
			co-orbital satellite avoids a
			collision with the first.

					MRS TROI
				(looking up)
			-- Deanna, darling! Thank the
			Four Dieties you're here.

					TROI
			I hope I'm not interrupting.

					PICARD
				(rising)
			No, as a matter of fact, I need
			to get back to the bridge myself.

					DATA
			Perhaps I should stay here and
			further entertain our guest.

					MRS. TROI
			-- No! I mean, I think you're
			needed on the bridge as well.

	Data frowns... then nods, realizing she's probably
	right.

					PICARD
				(a bit stiff)
			Thank you for a delicious meal.
			Let's uh, do it again sometime.

					MRS. TROI
				(purring)
			Oh, I know we will.

	Picard EXITS (followed by Data) a little embarrassed.
	Deanna looks at her mother with hard, accusing eyes.

					MRS. TROI
			Little One, the captain is every
			bit as charming as your father
			was.

	Mrs. Troi innocently takes a bite of her Betazoid
	dessert and Homn RINGS THE CHIME...

	Data and Picard walking together.

					PICARD
				(exhaling)
			Data, you'll never know just how
			much I owe you for that.

					DATA
			Indeed, Captain? I know many more
			interesting anecdotes as well.

37   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - THE CAPTAIN AND DATA

	EXIT the turbolift and ENTER the bridge. Riker swivels
	from his position at Command, and addresses Picard,
	still in dress uniform, who is moving toward the Ready
	Room...

					RIKER
			Status of the Antedian delegates
			unchanged, Captain.

					PICARD
			What's our e.t.a. to the
			conference?

					RIKER
			Forty five point three hours, sir.

					PICARD
			Very good, Number One. I'll be
			in my Ready Room.

	Picard ENTERS his Ready Room while Data crosses to Ops.

38   INT. MRS. TROI'S QUARTERS - HOMN

	bottle in hand, is cleaning up the table -- Mrs Troi
	is HUMMING to herself as she throws on a Betazoid
	shawl.

					TROI
			Why would you come aboard at a
			time like this?

38   CONTINUED:

					MRS. TROI
				(shrugging)
			I had no choice. I was going
			to Pacifica, you were going to
			Pacifica, it seemed the
			appropriate thing to do.

					TROI
			Don't be absurd -- you knew what
			this would lead to...

	Deanna trails off as she looks at Homn (she doesn't
	want to continue this conversation in front of anyone).
	She takes her mother by the arm and leads her out of
	the room.

39   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR - ON THE TROIS

	Deanna is animated and concerned while her mother is
	smiling and relaxed, nodding hello to passers-by...

					TROI
			What stage is it in?

					MRS. TROI
			I have it completely under
			control.

					TROI
				(demanding)
			What stage is it in?

					MRS. TROI
				(smiles)
			Well, far enough along for me to
			enjoy it, Little One.

					TROI
				(worried)
			Now I know why you wore that
			dress.

					MRS. TROI
				(laughing)
			Don't be ridiculous. It's just
			a simple little dress -- there's
			nothing provocative about it.

					TROI
				(more to herself)
			What are we going to do?

					MRS. TROI
			I'm going to do the only honorable
			thing there is to do.
				(smiles)
			And I'd say the captain has the
			inside track.

					TROI
			Don't even think it!

					MRS. TROI
			Why not? He was thinking about
			it all through dinner.

40   INT. CAPTAIN'S READY ROOM - TIGHT ON PICARD'S FACE

	He's in his regular uniform.

					PICARD
			I was what?!

41   PULL BACK TO INCLUDE RIKER AND TROI (OPTICAL)

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			I tell you Deanna, for a telepath,
			your mother's accuracy leaves much
			to be desired.

					TROI
			Actually, her telepathic prowess
			is quite advanced. Except for
			now.

					RIKER
			"Except for now?"

					PICARD
			Don't misunderstand me, Counselor.
			Your mother is a beautiful
			person...

					TROI
				(continuing)
			My mother is just beginning a
			physiological phase... one that
			all Betazoid women must deal with
			as they enter mid-life.

	Troi stops talking and looks at the men. The men look
	at each other...

          STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT TWO          27.

41   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			It's something Troi warned me
			about when we were first seeing
			each other.
				(looks at Troi)
			When a Betazoid female goes
			through "the Phase," it quadruples
			her sex drive.

					TROI
			Or more...

	Picard looks worried, Riker WHISTLES.

					RIKER
				(to Troi)
			... "or more?" I didn't know
			that.

					TROI
			I didn't want to frighten you.
				(to Picard)
			My mother has opted for the only
			dignified course of action open
			to her.

					RIKER
			Isolation?

					TROI
			She has chosen to focus all of
			her sexual energy on one male.
			This man will eventually become
			her husband, of course.
				(with difficulty)
			It seems Captain, that you are
			the early favorite.

					RIKER
			Congratulations, sir!

					PICARD
			I am not amused, Number One.
				(starts pacing again)
			There must be a way to convince
			her that it's quite impossible
			-- without offending her.

					TROI
			You cannot apply human style logic
			to this, Captain.

					TROI (Cont'd)
			Mother would be shocked and deeply
			resentful, should you spurn her
			advances. She would naturally
			take it very personally.

					PICARD
			Well, considering Starfleet's
			orders not to get her upset, I
			think it might be prudent for me
			to make myself less available for
			the duration of this journey.

					RIKER
			Agreed.

	Off this decision we GO TO:

	Picard walks toward the glass door with "his" name on

	decrepit hallway.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			It was a grey day in the city by

			You're too much, Dix. You make

			You got two calls...

			There's a gentleman here to see

					PICARD
			Thank you, Madeline.

	The secretary steps aside and then EXITS as SLADE

	Picard swivels his chair around and faces his visitor.
	He rises slowly, awkwardly lights a cigarette (chokes
	on it), and deliberately sizes up Slade Bender...

	Picard is feeling some pain from Slade's crushing grip.

					PICARD
			Yes... yes, I understand that.
			No funny things.

	Slade releases Picard's arm and the captain flexes and
	unflexes cramped muscles.

					SLADE
			I want you to find a missing

					PICARD
			Take it easy, Mac! I can't take

	Slade seems to think that over and ultimately agrees.
	He releases his vice-like grip.

				(continuing;

			As a matter of fact, I knew who

	Slade hovers over Picard again.

					SLADE
			Read what book? Are you being
			funny again?

					PICARD
				(to Slade)
			You got a picture?

					SLADE
			Of Alva?

					PICARD
			Of course of Alva! The novel

			I believe the 1940 expression was
			"hubbah, hubbah, hubbah."

					SLADE
			And I still say you talk funny.
			I don't like funny talk.

					PICARD
			That's part of the cost of hiring
			a private eye like me, Slade.
			I'm very different from most you

	Picard looks up at Slade, then back at the photo.

					SLADE
			I want you to find Alva. I'll

					PICARD
				(nods)
			Okay. I'll find Alva for you;

	Slade simply nods, and then turns and walks out the
	door. Picard calls after him and follows. Slade
	continues out the reception door and into the hallway.

	Mrs. Troi turns her attention from the Antedians to
	Worf and Wesley. She walks around them in a slow
	circle -- Homn follows, two steps behind.

					MRS. TROI
			You seem a fine boy. One day you

	Wesley looks over at Worf, wondering what she's getting
	at.

					MRS. TROI
				(continuing)
			But even though humans age far
			more rapidly than Betazoids, I
			cannot afford to wait for you to
			mature.

	This confuses Wesley even more. Mrs. Troi eyes Worf...

					MRS. TROI
				(smiling)
			But you... your innermost thoughts
			are primal, savage. I like that
			in a man.

					WORF
			I am not a man.

					MRS. TROI
			Which is in your favor, men so
			often being irrational and
			egotistical.
				(eyes him, then sighs)
			But I'm afraid I've grown
			accustomed to human companionship.
			It's nothing personal, you would
			have made a fine choice.

	Worf frowns -- he is about to ask her what she's
	talking about when she turns to her valet...

					MRS. TROI
			Who's next, Mister Homn?

	Homn puts his hands to his eyes and pantomimes the
	structure of a VISOR.

					MRS. TROI
			Ah yes. Let's get to it, I'm not
			getting any younger.

	Mrs. Troi EXITS, Homn bows to Wesley and Worf, then
	follows.

					WESLEY
			What was that all about?

	Worf has no idea.

	throbbing as Mrs. Troi and Mister Homn approach...

					MRS. TROI
			Lieutenant La Forge, I wish to
			be direct with you.

					GEORDI
				(turning to see her)
			I prefer it that way. Now what
			are you being direct about?

					MRS. TROI
			I have decided to give all the
			bridge officers an equal
			opportunity to gain my favor.

					GEORDI
			I see.

					MRS. TROI
			Ah, but you don't, and that's the
			problem. I wonder whether a
			sightless man could ever
			appreciate great beauty.

					GEORDI
			That's funny... I've always had
			the same doubts about the sighted.

					MRS. TROI
			Odd. How so?

					GEORDI
			Because my eyes don't seduce my
			mind, I'm driven to find beauty
			in other things -- things sighted
			people tend to ignore. The lovely
			temperature gradiations of bodies,
			the moisture patterns, the
			indications of inner peace and
			harmony...

	nodding slowly, agreeing completely.

54   BACK TO SHOT

					MRS. TROI
				(thoughtful)
			Very interesting, Lieutenant. But
			I'm not sure if that's good or

	Slade pulls out several crisp hundred dollar bills and
	hands one to Picard. Picard runs the bill between his
	fingers.

					PICARD
			You know it's wonderful to need
			money.

					SLADE
				(poking Picard's chest)
			You'll get more when you find

	He EXITS through the door -- WE CAN HEAR his heavy feet

	toward his office.

58   ANGLE TO REVEAL A MYSTERIOUS MAN IN A GREY SUIT

	leaning against the wall between Picard and the office.
	A fedora is tilted down over one eye making his face
	hard to see. He's looking down, lighting a cigarette.
	Picard pauses.

					PICARD
			Let's see... I must have been
			skimming pages about here. What
			part did you play?

	The man doesn't look up. Picard shrugs, saunters
	past; the man immediately moves up behind him, sticking
	a concealed gun against his back.

					TOUGHGUY
			Freeze.

					PICARD
			Ah, yes, of course.

					TOUGHGUY
			I'm looking for Slade Bender,
			Hill. I understand he was here
			yesterday.

					PICARD
			My, my, time does fly in the
			Holodeck.

	Hands up, Picard turns slowly and gets a look at his
	assailant. The Toughguy has olive skin, a jagged scar
	on his cheek and oddly pale eyes...

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Even if I happen to know a Slade
			Bender, why should I help you?

					TOUGHGUY
			Because he owes me money. And
			because if you don't, I'll blow
			your head off.

	A slow, cool smile spreads across Picard's face...

					PICARD
			I knew you'd say something like
			that. Marvelous.

	The Toughguy is really ticked off by Picard's
	unfathomable (to him) remark. He jams the gun against
	Picard's ribs...

58   CONTINUED:

					TOUGHGUY
			Cut the crap, Hill! Tell me where

			ya!

					PICARD
			I don't think so.

	With lightning quickness, Picard throws a classic
	punch, knocking his adversary reeling.

	The Toughguy swings about, shoves his gun into Picard's
	belly, FIRES. On Picard's look of astonishment:

	The hood is staring in disbelief at Picard.

					TOUGHGUY
			Come on, drop! I shot ya.

					PICARD
			No, the gun misfired. Thankfully
			the Holodeck is handling it
			correctly and the mortality
			failsafe is functional.

	The Toughguy suddenly swings his gun, catches Picard on
	the side of the head. It is a real blow which hurts.
	But Picard pulls the hood up by his tie, and knocks
	him out with a chopping overhand right.

60   CLOSER - PICARD

	He rubs the side of his head, finds blood there.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			But in some ways, the program is
			almost too accurate.

	Dixon Hill's secretary has come running out, having
	heard the shot. She immediately spots the blood on the
	side of Picard's head.

					SECRETARY
			Dixon, you're hurt!

	Picard grimaces in fine fashion...

					PICARD
			Don't worry about it.
				(shrugs)
			I'm going out for a drink.

	Dixon Hill's secretary looks on admiringly as her boss
	literally shrugs off his wound and EXITS the hallway.

	the tough-eyed Bartender who owns this dark, moody bar.
	The place is almost empty: a SAILOR sits next to a
	BLEACHED BLOND at the bar, a COUPLE OF HARD DRINKERS
	are at tables in the back. The jukebox is playing A
	MOURNFUL FORTIES TORCH SONG, and Rex is pouring scotch
	into the glass of a CHINESE-AMERICAN CUSTOMER...

	as Rex spots Picard at the door.

					REX
			Well hello, Dixon. Haven't seen

	Picard approaches the bar...

					REX
				(continuing)
			What's it been, four hours?

	Picard sticks out his hand and smiles...

					PICARD
			You must be Rex. Am I right?

					REX
			If you gotta ask me that pal, you
			need a drink.

					PICARD
				(sitting at bar)
			You're right, I do need a drink.

					REX
			The usual?

					PICARD
				(smiling, nodding)
			Let's see... Scotch, neat?

				(macho)
			So? I've got plenty more where

					REX
				(sincere)
			Geez, Dix. You're tough as

					PICARD
			Uggh, I'm going to have to get
			used to that.

					REX
				(dry)
			Yeah, it's only your third one
			today.

	Picard is still reeling from the drink. He closes his
	eyes and raps his fist on the bar.

					PICARD
			What the hell... make it four.

	The stoic Bartender pours...

			I'll put it on your tab.

					PICARD

			Mother, what are you doing here?
			You can't just stroll up to the

68   INT. REX'S BAR - PICARD

	is making love to his scotch. Rex is straight across
	from him, leaning against the bar; the classic
	bartender/customer scene. The bar has a few more
	PATRONS now...

					REX
			... So she says "Rex, when are
			you gonna sell the bar and get
			a real job? Make a shoe, mend
			a fence, do something useful?"
			Can you believe that, Dix?

					PICARD
			It's hard to believe, Rex.

					REX
			She just doesn't understand the
			service I perform here. My
			regulars depend on me to pour and
			listen, listen and pour. I'm like
			some kind'a psychologist to you
			guys, am I right?

	Both men are looking down now and shaking their heads.
	Rex starts to pour again, but stops as he sees someone

	to:

80   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MRS. TROI AND MR. HOMN

	who have just entered the bar. The wildly-dressed
	Betazoid and her giant valet look incredibly out of
	place in Chandlerland.

					REX
			I'll bet that's the broad with
			the big bucks!
				(to Mrs. Troi)
			Come on over here, darlin'. I
			got the best stool in the house
			saved for ya.

	Mrs. Troi saunters over and sits down -- still looking
	around the room with clear distaste.

              STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE             58.

80   CONTINUED:

					MRS. TROI
				(to Picard)
			I'm surprised you let this part
			of the ship get this dirty.

					PICARD
				(indicating Riker)
			Actually, that's the first
			officer's job.

					RIKER
				(nodding)
			Well, as a matter of fact...

					MRS. TROI
			Relax, Commander. You have begun
			making your true feelings clear.
			Obviously you feel unable to
			handle me.

					REX
			Anyway, why would a beautiful
			high-class lady like yourself...
				(indicates Riker)
			... want to hook up with a mug like
			that? You're too good for him,
			if you ask me.

	She leans across the bar and smiles...

					MRS. TROI
			I couldn't agree more.

					REX
			So... what'llitbe, Doll?

	Her attention is completely on the bartender.
	Something about him interests, then fascinates her.

					MRS. TROI
			You are a most interesting person.

					REX
			You're not so bad yourself. In
			fact, you're as much class as this
			joint's ever seen.

	He pulls out an opened bottle of house wine.

80   CONTINUED: (2)

					REX
			Here -- on the house. It's
			French... well, almost.

	She turns to Picard.

					MRS. TROI
			This is the most remarkable man.
			I have never met anyone quite
			like him.

					PICARD
			I don't suppose you have.

					MRS. TROI
			He's strong. I feel no thoughts
			from him... nothing. I've never
			known a man so able to keep his
			true feelings completely hidden.

					PICARD
			That's because...

					MRS. TROI
			No man has ever been such a
			mystery to me. I usually know
			their thoughts before they do.

					REX
			But not me, huh?

					MRS. TROI
			No. And I never realized how
			erotic that could be. Carry my
			beverage to that table... we have
			some things to talk about.

81   ANOTHER ANGLE

	as they watch Mrs. Troi walk over to the table. Rex
	picks up the glass of wine, gives Riker and Picard a
	little knowing wink, and heads for the table.

82   RIKER AND PICARD

	watch with amusement as Rex joins Mrs. Troi at the
	table and they begin a very intimate conversation.

					RIKER
			Should we tell her?

82   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			I think it's only fair, but let's
			allow her the moment.

	Riker has to smile. As we GO TO:

83   INT. SICKBAY - PULASKI AND WORF

	react with completely different expressions as

83A  THE ANTEDIANS

	awake, quite agitated, trembling as they squeak with:

					ANTEDIANS
			Food-food-food-food-food--

83B  PULASKI

	quickly realizes what must be done:

					PULASKI
			Worf! The vermicula!

	Worf picks up the scoop net, and digs into the tank,
	coming up with a load of writhing vermicula. The
	Antedians see it, and tremble with joy as Worf holds
	the net out for them and they gobble it up while...

					PULASKI
				(touching communicator)
			Pulaski to Captain Picard.

84   INT. REX'S BAR

	Picard is still with Riker

					PICARD
			Go ahead, Doctor.

					PULASKI COM VOICE
			Our passengers are on their feet.

					PICARD
			Understood.

					RIKER
			I had better get to the bridge.

84   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			What's their condition?

					PULASKI COM VOICE
			Hungry.

	Picard acknowledges with a nod. Riker EXITS.

85   ANOTHER ANGLE BAR

	Picard crosses to the table occupied by Rex and Mrs.
	Troi.

					PICARD
			Coming, Mrs. Troi?

					MRS. TROI
			Not just yet. Tell William I'm
			sorry... but Rex and I are
			getting married.

              STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE             61.

85   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Mrs. Troi, your government expects
			us to deliver you to the
			conference and I intend to do
			that!

	Mrs. Troi considers it, nods and rises, patting Rex on
	the cheek.

					MRS. TROI
			Duty calls, darling. I'll be back
			for you later.

86   ANOTHER ANGLE

	As Picard and Mrs. Troi walk toward the exit.

					PICARD
			There is something about Rex I
			think you had better know...

	The rest of the conversation is lost as the doors close
	behind them.

87   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit around blue Pacifica.

88   INT. CORRIDOR AT THE TURBOLIFT

	as it opens and Mrs. Troi EXITS, followed closely by
	Deanna and Mister Homn (who is effortlessly carrying her
	suitcase). Mrs. Troi leads the way down the corridor
	at a brisk pace, in a bad mood.

					MRS. TROI
			Imagine -- allowing me to go on
			like that with a simple bartender
			who doesn't even exist!

					TROI
				(amused)
			Mother, you always say you like
			new experiences.

89   INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM - THE TROI ENTOURAGE (OPTICAL)

	arrives to find the Antedians on the platform and
	Picard, Riker, Data and Worf there to see them off.
	She indicates the Antedians...

					MRS. TROI
			Why are they still here?

					RIKER
			We thought that since you're going
			to the same conference, you might
			like to beam down with the other
			delegates.

					MRS. TROI
				(casually)
			They're not delegates. Those two
			are assassins.

					ANTEDIAN FEMALE
			That is... an outrage!... Lies!
			We demand you... transport at
			once!

					MRS. TROI
			Oh honey, don't bother to deny
			it. Your minds are so
			unsophisticated -- I can read your
			thoughts in my sleep.
				(to Picard, offhand)
			The inside of their robes are
			lined with ultritium. Highly
			explosive and virtually
			undetectable by your transporter.

	Data is already aiming his tri-corder at their robes...

					DATA
				(surprised)
			She is correct, sir. I am
			detecting large amounts of
			ultritium.

					MRS. TROI
			Of course you are. They planned
			to blow up the entire conference.

	Worf has drawn his phaser.

					PICARD
			Take them to level five. Disarm
			them and hold for questioning.

              STAR TREK: "Manhunt" - 3/29/89 - ACT FIVE             63.

89   CONTINUED:

	Worf leads the angry Antedians away -- they hiss at
	Mrs. Troi as they pass by. Mrs. Troi gives Deanna a
	hug and steps onto the platform, followed of course by
	Homn.

					MRS. TROI
				(sighing)
			Oh well, I didn't find a mate but
			I saved the conference as well
			as your reputations. All in a
			day's work I suppose.

					PICARD
			Good-bye Mrs. Troi... and thank
			you.

	She closes her eyes and nods her head, showing she's
	ready. Picard signals the transporter chief and Homn
	and Mrs. Troi begin to DEMATERIALIZE. Suddenly she
	opens her eyes and looks right at Picard.

					MRS. TROI
				(scolding, excited)
			Jean-Luc! Shame on you for
			thinking such a thing!

	And they're gone. All eyes turn to Picard...

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

1    INT. DATA'S QUARTERS

	RIKER, PULASKI, GEORDI, DATA, and WORF, in that order,
	sit around the table playing poker. By far, Worf has
	the biggest stack of chips.

					RIKER
				(eyeing his cards)
			Lookin' good. I say... five.

	Riker throws in five chips. Pulaski meets the bet.

					PULASKI
			Five here.

					GEORDI
				(adding chips)
			And five more.

					DATA
				(evaluating)
			I believe the wiser course of
			action here is to bend.

					GEORDI
			You mean fold.

					DATA
			That is correct. Fold -- to bend,
			make compact or give in.

	Data lays his cards on the table. All eyes on Worf.
	Worf calmly counts the right amount of chips and puts
	them in the pile. Then he adds two more large stacks
	of chips.

					WORF
			I raise fifty.

	Everyone is taken aback.

					DATA
			I do not believe Lieutenant Worf
			understands all the nuances of
			this betting procedure.

        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/14/89 - TEASER        2.

1    CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			Don't be too quick to judge, Data.
			His pile's a lot bigger than
			yours.

					PULASKI
			Than all of ours.

					DATA
			The cards have been favoring the
			Lieutenant, but that is the result
			of random chance... hence it is
			a temporary condition.

					GEORDI
			You hope.

					WORF
			Talk or play. Not both.

	Riker thinks it over.

					RIKER
			Fifty, right?

					PULASKI
			Fifty is the bet. What's the
			matter -- are your feet getting
			cold?

					RIKER
			No, just my cards...

	He bets, somewhat less sure of himself.

					PULASKI
			Thanks for staying in -- I need
			the chips.

					RIKER
			Got to earn them first.

					PULASKI
			Oh, I will. This pot has my name
			on it.

					GEORDI
			Talk, talk, talk...

	Pulaski bets.

        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/14/89 - TEASER        2A.

1    CONTINUED: (2)

					PULASKI
			Here's some action. Fifty...
				(adds more)
			... and another fifty.

					GEORDI
				(backpedalling)
			Fold, fold, fold...

	Geordi throws in his hand. Worf pushes out four
	stacks of chips and adds another two.

					WORF
			Your fifty, and fifty more.

	Riker looks at Worf and at Pulaski -- who stare at each
	other. Pulaski smiles but Worf is deadpan.

					RIKER
			Love to stay in -- but not with
			these cards.

	Riker folds.

					PULASKI
				(to Worf)
			Looks like it's just you and me,
			handsome.

	Worf is a statue. Pulaski gathers up the needed
	amount. It takes every last chip she has, but --

					PULASKI (cont'd)
			I'll see you.

	Pulaski pushes in the needed amount. Everyone stares
	at Worf as he slowly puts down his cards. A full house
	-- aces over queens.

					PULASKI (cont'd)
			Beats my straight.

	Everyone except Worf SIGHS as the tension is released.

        STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - TEASER        3.

1    CONTINUED: (2)

					RIKER
			The Iceman wins again.

					PULASKI
			You took my last chip. You could
			at least smile, Worf.

	Worf says nothing; he simply pulls in all the chips
	and stacks them, preparing for the next hand.

					GEORDI
			Smiling might break his
			concentration.

					PULASKI
			If you don't enjoy winning -- what
			do you enjoy? Losing?

					RIKER
			We'd be happy to accommodate you.

	Worf, unruffled, collects the cards and hands them to
	Data.

					WORF
			Your deal.

	Data takes the cards, shuffles them like an old pro,
	and deals.

					DATA
			The game is seven card stud; after
			the queen, one-eyed jacks and low
			card in the hole are wild.

					GEORDI
			Let me write this down.

					RIKER
			Just deal. I'd like to get some
			of my losings back before the next
			century.

	Pulaski and Geordi CHUCKLE.

					WORF
			I open with fifty.

			Command.

	Instantly, the players throw their cards onto the

			On my way.

	-- and head for the door. As they cross:

					GEORDI
				(to Worf)
			Fifty? You were bluffing.

					WORF
			Klingons never bluff.

	Geordi gives Worf a look of uncertainty -- is Worf
	kidding? -- as the group EXITS.

			Mister Data?

			Emergency signal reads as follows:
			Enterprise to divert to

			Our destination is a point near

			Any problems reported in that

					ADMIRAL GROMEK
			Greetings, Captain Picard.

			My compliments, Admiral Gromek.

					ADMIRAL GROMEK
			Captain, you'll soon be joined
			by a Federation special emissary
			from Starbase one five three.
			We're now transmitting the
			specifics.

	Picard looks to Data, who's checking readouts.

					DATA
				(nods to Picard)
			We are receiving.

					ADMIRAL GROMEK
			The rendezvous will be a bit
			tricky, so it's imperative you
			reach the intercept point on
			schedule.

					PICARD
			Understood. And -- the mission?

					ADMIRAL GROMEK
			The envoy will fill you in. You
			are to cooperate fully.

					PICARD
			Can you give me any details?

					ADMIRAL GROMEK
			Negative.

					PICARD
			Admiral, I find it difficult to
			prepare for a mission I know
			nothing about.

					ADMIRAL GROMEK
				(softening)
			I sympathize, Jean-Luc, but
			Starfleet Command considers this
			a top-security matter.

	Surprised reactions from the group.

					RIKER
			A class eight probe is just over
			two meters long!

					PICARD
				(thinking)
			True, Number One. But if the
			sensors and transmitters were
			removed and life-support
			installed, there would be just
			enough space for one person.

					RIKER
			And those probes are designed to
			go warp nine.

					DATA
				(nods)
			By sending the probe to meet us
			rather than diverting the
			Enterprise to the starbase, they
			have saved us six point one hours.

					PICARD
			Obviously Starfleet feels that
			time is of the essence.

					RIKER
			Yes, but still... to seal someone
			up inside a Class Eight Probe and
			then just launch it off...
				(shakes his head)
			Hell of a way to transport a
			Federation dignitary.

					PICARD
				(to Clancey)
			We'll need an intercept course
			with pin-point accuracy. The
			probe carrying the emissary has
			no means of navigation...

					RIKER
				(finishing the thought)
			... so if we don't catch it on the
			first try, we'll have to chase
			it.

					GEORDI
			Captain, we have a way to save
			you some time.

					PICARD
			Proceed.

					O'BRIEN
			I believe we can beam the probe
			aboard while we're still
			travelling at Warp Nine.

					RIKER
				(a low whistle)
			Quite a trick.

					GEORDI
			Right -- at warp speed it's
			nearly impossible to get a solid
			transporter lock. But if we
			caught the probe with a tractor
			beam...

					RIKER
				(catching on)
			We could use the tractor beam to
			focus the transporter.

					GEORDI
			Exactly.

					PICARD
			Risks?

					GEORDI
			None to the emissary. There's
			a chance the probe could break
			free... then we'd have to find
			it and start over.

	Under this, Pulaski has repeated the medical scan.

					PULASKI
			How are you feeling? Your vital

					K'EHLEYR
			No doubt because I am only half

					K'EHLEYR
			Two days ago, Starbase three three six
			received an automated
			transmission from a Klingon ship,
			the T'Ong.
				(a beat)
			That ship was sent out over
			seventy-five years ago.

					RIKER
			When the Federation and the
			Klingon Empire were still at
			war...

					K'EHLEYR
			The message was directed to the
			Klingon High Command. It said
			only that the T'Ong was returning
			home and was about to reach the
			"awakening point."

					PICARD
			Which suggests that the crew was
			in cryogenic sleep for most of
			the long voyage.

					K'EHLEYR
			Exactly.

					RIKER
			And when the crew is revived...

					K'EHLEYR
				(nods)
			... we'll have a ship full of
			Klingons who think the war is
			still going on.

     STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - REV. 4/12/89 - ACT TWO     19.

33   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			So our task is to find the ship,
			and tell the Klingons we are no
			longer at war.

					RIKER
			Why us? A Klingon ship would have
			been a better choice.

					K'EHLEYR
			A Klingon ship -- the P'rang --
			is on its way, but it's two days
			behind us. That may be too late.

					TROI
			Why too late?

					RIKER
			Because the T'Ong's crew is about
			to awaken within striking range
			of a dozen Federation outposts.

					DATA
			There are thirteen colonies
			with minimal defenses in that
			sector...

					K'EHLEYR
				(nods)
			Nice ripe targets for a Klingon
			warship.

					TROI
			And you believe you can convince
			these Klingons that humans are
			now their allies?

					K'EHLEYR
			No. Not a chance.

	Everyone is surprised.

					K'EHLEYR (cont'd)
			If you ask me, talking will be
			a waste of time. Klingons of that
			era were raised to despise humans.
				(shrugs)
			We'll try diplomacy. But I
			promise you -- it won't work.
			And then you'll have to destroy

			No.

					K'EHLEYR
			No? Captain, these Klingons are

					PICARD
			Find me another choice. I want

					PICARD

					WORF
			Sir... I suggest Commander Riker

					TROI
			And your Klingon side?

			That, I keep under tight control.
			It's like a terrible temper --
			it's not something I want people

			Why hide it? We all have

			Come on -- what happened to the

					WORF
			He became a Starfleet lieutenant.

					K'EHLEYR
			Well, there's something wrong with

			And it gives you no pleasure to

			Not as far as I'm concerned.

39   ON K'EHLEYR

	It's as if he slapped her face. Worf turns back to

			regarding the ship's mission.

					K'EHLEYR
				(indifferent)
			So?

					WORF
			You're not interested in why the
			ship was sent out?

					K'EHLEYR
				(shrugs)
			Probably some secret military
			objective.

					WORF
			Perhaps, but we have no evidence
			of that --

					K'EHLEYR
			Why else would there be no record
			of the mission?

					WORF
			The records may simply have been

					K'EHLEYR
			In any case, what does it matter?

					WORF
			And to contend with that threat,
			we need information.

	They're both getting irritated with one another.

					K'EHLEYR
			We have all the information we

					WORF
			That is foolish. Knowing their

					K'EHLEYR
				(cutting him)
			There's nothing to understand!
			They're Klingons! They'll attack!
			In their minds, we're the enemy
			-- and there's no way we're going

					WORF
				(strained patience)
			There are always options.

					K'EHLEYR
			Oh, are there? Tell me: whatever

					WORF
			My experience aboard this ship

					K'EHLEYR
			Starfleet hasn't improved you

					WORF
				(losing his temper)
			Are you going to carry out your

			All right! I will!

	She puts her fingers to her temples, closes her eyes

48   INT. HOLODECK - BATTLEGROUND

	Twilight. A shattered, desolate terrain. Rocks,
	ruins, shadows. K'Ehleyr, cat-like, moves silently
	through it. She's alert, coiled, ready for anything.
	She's wearing a Klingon glove/weapon similar to the one
	worn by Worf in "Where Silence Has Lease."

	Then, seemingly from nowhere, a massive ALIEN WARRIOR
	springs into view, charges at K'Ehleyr.

49   ON K'EHLEYR

	calmly dodging the alien's blow and smashing the side
	of her fist into the alien's face. The alien SNARLS
	and attacks again.

	standing on the sidelines and watching with interest.

51   ON K'EHLEYR

	as the alien tries to get an arm around her throat.

	A long beat as she and Worf gaze at each other. He's
	seen a side of her -- her Klingon side -- that she lets
	no one see, and she's uncomfortable.

	Then, K'Ehleyr breaks the eye contact, shrugs with

	The barest hint of a smile.

	as suddenly the "dead" alien Warrior is back on its
	feet, joined by TWO MORE ALIEN WARRIORS; all three are
	brandishing gleaming, razor-edged swords.

	On a nearby rock are two swords; Worf and K'Ehleyr pick
	up the swords as the aliens ROAR and attack --

61   ANGLE ON THE FIGHT

	Everything we've seen is tame compared to what follows.
	Worf and K'Ehleyr turn into fighting machines --
	vicious, snarling animals whose only goal is survival.

62   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	Worf and K'Ehleyr are a blur. Blades flash and CLANG.
	The aliens drop, unable to withstand the dual
	onslaught. One alien is literally sliced in half.

	And, almost before it's begun, it's over -- Worf and
	K'Ehleyr are the only ones left standing.

63   ON WORF AND K'EHLEYR

	sweaty, breathing hard, covered with grime -- but
	triumphant.

	Slowly, swords still in hand, Worf and K'Ehleyr turn
	toward one another -- eyes hard, expressions ferocious,
	blood still boiling.

64   WIDER

	as Worf quite deliberately tosses his sword aside.
	K'Ehleyr raises hers in defense -- but Worf is already
	upon her, gripping her sword-arm.

	K'Ehleyr struggles, but Worf is stronger -- inexorably
	bending her arm back and making her drop the sword.

66   ON K'EHLEYR

	eyes ablaze in challenge and defiance. Worf locks his
	gaze to hers. They're almost nose to nose. A long
	beat of tense, silent communication. Then, Worf shoves
	her away.

	Her eyes never leaving his, K'Ehleyr slowly removes
	her glove, extends her naked hand to Worf.

66F  NEW ANGLE

	as they move closer. Except for their hands on each
	other's wrists, they have not touched, nor do they
	now... instead, they sniff at each other's hair, their
	ears, their necks. It's slow, ritualized -- and also
	instinctive, primal, animal behavior.

	Their passion mounting, Worf and K'Ehleyr release their
	grips, then extend their hands to one another.

66G  CLOSE ON THEIR HANDS

	as they touch their wrists, then the heels of their
	hands together. Their fingers intertwine -- their
	palms touch -- their grips tighten -- and they savagely
	clasp hands... so tightly that their nails dig in and
	draw blood.

66H  WIDER

	Worf and K'Ehleyr violently draw each other close.
	With a low GROWL, Worf buries his face in K'Ehleyr's

			I did not say that.

	K'Ehleyr waits, but nothing else is forthcoming.

					K'EHLEYR
				(exasperated)
			Worf, you're the perfect Klingon

			Don't give me that Klingon

			Worf, it was what it was!
			Glorious and wonderful and all

			That is a human attitude.

					K'EHLEYR

	Worf's had enough debate. He steps back atop the rock,

			Overtake. Warp eight.

					CLANCEY
			Aye.

					PICARD
			Put us right in their path and
			come to a full stop.
				(to Tactical)
			Full power to shields.

					TACTICAL CREWMAN
			Full power, sir.

87A  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	coming out of warp and stopping.

           STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE           49.

87B  INT. MAIN BRIDGE

					PICARD
			We've thrown down the gauntlet...
			let's see if they pick it up.

					DATA
			They are slowing to impulse --

88   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	On the screen, the star field SHIMMERS -- and the T'Ong
	APPEARS as it drops its cloaking. It FIRES phasers at
	us --

89   NEW ANGLE

	as the bridge is SHAKEN slightly by the attack.

					TACTICAL CREWMAN
			Phaser hit on forward shields.
			No damage.

					DATA
			The T'Ong is attempting to flank
			us.

					PICARD
			Compensate.

90   ANGLE TO INCLUDE MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	as the T'Ong FIRES a photon torpedo --

91   NEW ANGLE

	as the torpedo hits, SHAKING the ship a bit more.

					TACTICAL CREWMAN
			Photon torpedo hit. Shield number
			two weakened... firming up now...
			No damage.

					RIKER
			I think we've piqued their
			curiosity by now...

         STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT FIVE        50.

91   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Agreed. Let's give them the
			chance to look their enemy in the
			face.

	Picard turns to look offscreen. We don't see who he's
	addressing:

					PICARD (cont'd)
			Ready, Lieutenant?
				(then to Tactical)
			Open a hailing frequency.

					TACTICAL CREWMAN
			Hailing frequency open, sir.

92   OMITTED

93   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	motionless, facing the T'Ong.

94   INT. MAIN BRIDGE - CLOSE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	as the image of the T'Ong is replaced by a view of the
	T'ONG BRIDGE. K'TEMOC, the captain, is a formidable
	warrior who commands his ship with a typical Klingon
	iron first. A FIRST OFFICER and another KLINGON CREWMAN
	are in the b.g.

	The Klingons all react with surprise. K'Temoc leaps
	to his feet --

					K'TEMOC
			What --

95   ANGLE ON THE ENTERPRISE COMMAND CHAIR

	The captain of the Enterprise is a Klingon! Worf, in
	full Klingon captain regalia, sits in the command chair
	glaring at K'Temoc.

	Next to Worf is K'Ehleyr, similarly in full Klingon
	uniform.

	Picard and Riker are not visible, but Data, Clancey,
	Geordi, and the tactical crewman are at their stations.

         STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT FIVE       50A.

95   CONTINUED:

					WORF
				(imperious)
			Captain K'Temoc -- have you lost
			your mind? Halt your ship and
			drop your shields.

           STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE           51.

96   ANGLE ON MAIN VIEWER (OPTICAL)

	The Klingon crewmen are stunned. So is K'Temoc, but
	he keeps a lid on it and blusters back to Worf:

					K'TEMOC
			What treachery is this? By whose
			authority?

97   ANGLE ON WORF (OPTICAL)

	Worf gives K'Temoc a look as if K'Temoc were a two-year-old
	challenging a parent.

					WORF
			I am Worf, commanding the
			Enterprise. It is you who have
			committed an act of treason --
			by firing upon this ship.

98   INTERCUTS -- WORF AND VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

					K'TEMOC
			I have standing orders to fire
			on all Federation ships. We are
			at war.

					WORF
			You fool. Did it not occur to
			you that the war would be over
			by now?

					K'TEMOC
			I have no proof of that.

					WORF
			Trust your eyes! Or is your brain
			still stuck in its long slumber?

					K'TEMOC
			How can I be sure this is not a
			Federation trick?

	Worf SIGHS. Why must underlings make life difficult?

					WORF
			Captain, as you are new to this
			century, I have tried to be
			patient. But I will tolerate no
			further insubordination. Drop
			your shields immediately.

           STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE           52.

98   CONTINUED:

					K'TEMOC
				(still belligerent)
			And if I refuse?

					WORF
			Then die in ignorance. I can
			waste no more time on you.
				(to Tactical)
			Phasers to full power.

					TACTICAL CREWMAN
			Aye, sir.
				(does so)
			Phasers ready. Target locked.

99   NEW ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	On the screen, K'Temoc plays his last card:

					K'TEMOC
			You dare not destroy us. We have
			been on a crucial mission by order
			of the Klingon High Command...

	Worf, the Iceman, impassively raises his hand as a
	signal to fire.

					WORF
			Has the T'Ong dropped its shields?

					TACTICAL CREWMAN
			No, sir.

					WORF
				(with a shrug)
			Very well. Fire all phasers --

					K'TEMOC
			Wait!

	K'Temoc crosses his arms and gently bows his head.

					K'TEMOC (cont'd)
				(to first officer)
			Lower the shields.
				(to Worf)
			I yield command of the T'Ong to
			you, Captain Worf. Long live the
			Klingon Empire.

	Worf is deadpan, indifferent.

         STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT FIVE        53.

99   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			A wise decision, Captain.
			Commander K'Ehleyr will board your
			ship and take command. The
			Klingon cruiser P'rang will soon
			arrive and escort you home.
				(almost an afterthought)
			And, Captain --

					K'TEMOC
			Yes?

					WORF
			Welcome to the twenty-fourth century.

	And with that, the Enterprise viewscreen returns to
	the exterior view of the T'Ong. RED ALERT ENDS.

100  ANGLE ON WORF (OPTICAL)

	As Picard and Riker approach from o.s. The mood is
	jubilant. Worf stands.

					WORF
				(to Picard)
			I return command of the ship to
			you, Captain.

					PICARD
			Thank you and congratulations,
			Lieutenant. A very fine first
			command. Well done.

	Worf nods a silent acknowledgement.

					GEORDI
			That's all, Worf? Just a nod?

	Worf is again unflappable.

					RIKER
			How did you like command?

	Worf looks at the crew, then back at the captain's
	chair.

					WORF
			Comfortable chair.

         STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - REV. 4/14/89 - ACT FIVE        54.

100  CONTINUED:

	Everyone but Worf smiles.

									CUT TO:

101  INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM

	K'Ehleyr and Worf ENTER.

					WORF
				(to O'Brien)
			One to beam aboard the T'Ong.

	O'Brien acknowledges with a nod and punches in the
	coordinates.

					O'BRIEN
			All set.

					WORF
			I relieve you.

	O'Brien opens his mouth to say something, changes his
	mind -- Worf's expression makes it clear he wants to be
	alone.

					O'BRIEN
			Yes, Lieutenant.

	And O'Brien exits.

           STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE           55.

102  NEW ANGLE

	Worf turns to face K'Ehleyr. They treat each other in
	the most formal manner -- perhaps as a way of easing
	the separation.

					WORF
			The Klingon vessel P'rang will
			rendezvous with you in three days.

					K'EHLEYR
			In the meantime, I'll begin the
			assimilation of these Klingons
			to our era.

	A silent look. Is that all?

					WORF
			Is there anything else you
			require?

					K'EHLEYR
			No. Nothing else.

	K'Ehleyr takes a step towards the transporter, stops
	and turns back to face Worf.

					K'EHLEYR
			Damn you, Worf. You'd let me go
			without saying another word,
			wouldn't you?

					WORF
			What needs to be said?

					K'EHLEYR
			Nothing. Everything. We're about
			to go our separate ways again.

					WORF
			And that disturbs you?

					K'EHLEYR
				(takes a breath)
			Yes, it does.

	She moves closer to him.

         STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - REV. 4/12/89 - ACT FIVE        56.

102  CONTINUED:

					K'EHLEYR (cont'd)
			I hid the truth from you. Last
			night did have meaning.
				(a beat)
			I was tempted to take the oath
			with you. That scared me. I've
			never had such strong feelings
			toward anyone.

					WORF
				(after a beat)
			Nor have I.

	K'Ehleyr's stunned. From Worf, that's quite an
	admission.

					K'EHLEYR
			Then it was more than just a point
			of honor.

	Worf's silence is eloquent.

					K'EHLEYR (cont'd)
			Maybe someday, when our paths
			cross again, I won't be as easy
			to get rid of.

	K'Ehleyr and Worf extend their hands, touch palms, and
	clasp -- a gentle version of the passionate handclasp
	they shared in the Holodeck.

					WORF
			K'Ehleyr... I will not be complete
			without you.

	A long beat. Then, K'Ehleyr steps onto the transporter
	pad.

103  ON WORF

	Perhaps to cover his sorrow, his face bears something
	with a close resemblance to a smile...

104  ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD (OPTICAL)

	as K'Ehleyr DEMATERIALIZES.

           STAR TREK: "The Emissary" - 4/10/89 - ACT FIVE           57.

105  CLOSE ON WORF

	as his face returns to the more familiar unemotional
	expression of -- the Iceman.

									FADE OUT.

                        END OF ACT FIVE
