1    EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AT STARBASE (OPTICAL)

	The ship is docked at the starbase seen in
	"Redemption."

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, stardate 45233.1.
			Our terraforming mission to Doraf
			One has been suddenly cancelled
			and the Enterprise recalled to
			Starbase Two-thirty-four. Fleet
			Admiral Brackett would not discuss
			the matter on subspace for
			reasons she said would soon be
			clear...

2    INT. ENTERPRISE - READY ROOM

	ADMIRAL BRACKETT, regal and poised as ever, with PICARD.

   STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - REV. 9/18/91 - TEASER   2.

2    CONTINUED:

					ADMIRAL BRACKETT
			I apologize for the mystery,
			Captain... but we must attempt
			to contain the information I'm
			about to reveal to you... at least
			as long as possible...

					PICARD
			I will admit you've piqued my
			curiosity, Admiral.

					ADMIRAL BRACKETT
			Three weeks ago, one of our most
			celebrated ambassadors -- an
			advisor to Federation leaders for
			generations -- disappeared. He
			left no word of his destination.

	Brackett moves toward Picard's desk, and activates his
	computer.

					ADMIRAL BRACKETT
			Two days ago, intelligence reports
			placed him on Romulus -- and I
			assure you it's an unauthorized
			visit. Computer, initiate linkage
			between this terminal and starbase
			computer system alpha-two-nine.

					COMPUTER VOICE
			Linkage complete.

					PICARD
			A defection?

					ADMIRAL BRACKETT
			If it is, the damage to Federation
			security would be incalculable.

	Brackett taps a few instructions and then gestures for
	Picard to look.

3    INSERT - MONITOR (OPTICAL)

	A fuzzy, out-of-focus picture, with margins showing
	on screen, comes into frame -- something obviously
	taken on a very long lens. There are several blurred
	figures, none of them identifiable.

   STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - REV. 9/18/91 - TEASER   3.

4    BACK TO SCENE

					ADMIRAL BRACKETT
			Taken on Romulus, by long-range
			scanner. Computer, enhance image
			in section four-delta.

4A   INSERT - MONITOR (OPTICAL)

	as the blurred images come into sharper relief... the
	center one particularly... and as it becomes focused,
	we recognize the unmistakable image of Spock, dressed
	in Romulan clothing.

4B   BACK TO SCENE

	to show Picard's shocked face. On his surprise and the
	Admiral's grim intent...

									FADE OUT.

5    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	coming out of warp.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, stardate 45236.4.
			As I study the intelligence
			reports on Ambassador Spock's
			disappearance, I cannot help but
			feel a deeper, more personal
			concern about this mission, for
			I know this man through his
			father. It was barely a year ago
			that I shared a mind meld with
			the Vulcan Sarek... now we must
			meet again as I attempt to find
			an explanation for his son's
			actions.

	(Part of the log can fall over the following --)

5A   INT. ENTERPRISE - OBSERVATION LOUNGE

	Moving along several PADDs spread out across the
	table... as well as other reports... clearly Picard
	has been doing a great deal of homework... but as we
	find him he is musing, staring out the window at the
	stars... Riker ENTERS...

					RIKER
			We'll be coming into orbit of
			Vulcan in less than an hour,
			Captain... you may want to get
			some rest...

					PICARD
			Yes, yes, of course, you're
			right...

	But he doesn't get up, his eye is caught by another
	PADD on his desk... he's tired, but his mind is busy...

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE     5.

5A   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			We should notify Sarek's wife of
			our plans...

					RIKER
			All taken care of, sir... she'll
			be transporting aboard at oh-seven
			hundred...

					PICARD
			And Sarek?

					RIKER
			She says he is too ill to join
			her.

					PICARD
				(nods)
			Not unexpected. The man is dying.
			And I have the... honor... to
			bring him the news that his son
			may have betrayed the Federation.

	Riker sits.

					RIKER
			How well do you know Spock?

					PICARD
			I met him only once... what I know
			of him comes from history books
			and of course the mind meld with
			his father...

					RIKER
			That must cover a lot of ground...

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE     6.

5A   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Not as much as you'd imagine...
			Sarek and Spock...

	He pauses, inclined not to go any deeper into this...

					PICARD
			... Well, sometimes, fathers and
			sons...

	He doesn't need to finish...

					RIKER
				(from personal
				 experience)
			Understood.

	Picard nods, rises and Riker follows suit... Picard
	gets an additional thought... he picks up a PADD...

					PICARD
			Oh there was one other thing...
			take a look at this...

	Hands it to Riker, who glances at it, raises an
	eyebrow...

					PICARD
			Something that turned up during
			the intelligence sweep... what
			do you make of it?

					RIKER
				(re: the PADD)
			Metal fragments, possibly
			disassembled components,
			identified as Vulcan... recovered
			from a downed Ferengi ship...

					PICARD
			And the crates they were in were
			marked as medical supplies.

					RIKER
			Contraband?

	Picard shakes his head, doesn't know... as they EXIT...

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     6A.

5A   CONTINUED: (4)

					PICARD
			They've been sent to Vulcan for
			identification... Starfleet has
			requested we lend them a hand...

	Riker acknowledges and they're out...

5B   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit of Vulcan.

6    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM (OPTICAL)

	Picard waits with a TRANSPORTER OFFICER as PERRIN
	MATERIALIZES on the pad. She walks forward, extending
	her arms, obviously glad to see Picard again. She is
	as lovely and gracious as ever, her eyes holding the
	only clue to the pain she carries from Sarek's illness.

					PERRIN
			Captain Picard...

					PICARD
			Perrin...

	They shake hands and start toward the door.

					PERRIN
			It's good to see you again.

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     7.

6    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			And you. How is Sarek?

	They EXIT the transporter room.

7    INT. CORRIDOR

	as they walk toward a turbolift.

					PERRIN
			He has good days... and bad days.
			More and more they're bad...

					PICARD
			Then the disease has progressed...

					PERRIN
			It is a cruel killer. Sarek
			deserves a noble death... instead
			he is trapped in this lingering
			madness...

					PICARD
			It must be very hard for you.

	She casts him a swift glance. Not many people ever
	think of her feelings, her needs. She is grateful for
	Picard's sensitivity.

					PERRIN
			Every day I can share with him
			is a gift. The pain will be in
			losing him.

					PICARD
			I hope that will not be soon.

					PERRIN
			There's no way to tell. At times
			I think he won't make it through
			another night... and then it seems
			he's strong enough to live for
			years...

	They walk quietly for a beat, then --

					PICARD
			I admire your strength more than
			I can tell you.

	Again, she gives him a sidelong glance, but he's
	looking straight ahead. They walk on in silence.

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     8.

8    INT. READY ROOM

	Picard is at the replicator, just removing two cups
	of tea. He gives her a cup of steaming tea and she
	takes it, inhaling the vapor.

					PERRIN
			Mint tea... it's been years since
			I've had it... Vulcans have some
			strange concoction they call
			"mint"... but you wouldn't
			recognize it...

	She sips at it, turning away to look out the windows.
	Picard regards her for a moment, realizing she is
	reluctant to get into discussion of the real purpose
	of his visit. But he has no such luxury.

					PICARD
			Perrin... you know why I've come
			to Vulcan.

	She seems to stiffen a moment, doesn't turn around,
	doesn't answer.

					PICARD
			I must ask you about Spock.

	Now she turns, and there's a bitterness in her eyes
	that can't be concealed.

					PERRIN
			He didn't even say good-bye to
			his father before he left.

					PICARD
			Is it possible he was abducted?

					PERRIN
			No. He wrapped up his affairs
			very carefully. He knew he was
			going.

					PICARD
			Do you have any idea why he might
			have disappeared like this?

	Perrin drills him a look, works to get under control.
	This whole subject is clearly a sore spot with her.

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     9.

8    CONTINUED:

					PERRIN
			Captain, as far as I'm concerned
			he disappeared a long time ago.

	She rises, trying to contain her emotions...

					PERRIN
			Excuse me for sounding like the
			wicked stepmother...

					PICARD
			Would it be inappropriate to ask
			what happened between you and
			Spock?

					PERRIN
			Not between us. Between Spock
			and his father. They had argued
			for years; that was family...
			but when the debates over the
			Cardassian war began, he attacked
			Sarek's position... publicly...
			he showed no loyalty to his
			father...

					PICARD
			I was not aware that Sarek was
			offended by Spock's opposition...

					PERRIN
			I was offended. And I made sure
			Spock knew it.
				(beat, softer)
			I am very protective of my
			husband. I do not apologize for
			it.

	A beat.

					PICARD
			Would Sarek have any idea why
			Spock might have left?

	Perrin turns and walks away from him, pauses at a
	distance, hesitates before answering. If it were
	anyone else, she would never become so personal, so
	revealing...

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     9A.

8    CONTINUED: (2)

					PERRIN
			I don't know.
				(beat)
			If you could see Sarek as I do...
			wasting in bed... whispering to
			himself...

	She turns back to Picard, in anguish.

					PERRIN
			He wants to see his son... to heal
			any rifts that still remain...
			but now it may be too late.

	Her voice breaks and she turns away, not wanting to
	lose control in front of Picard. He is sobered by her
	distress.

					PICARD
				(gently)
			Perrin... would you allow me to
			see Sarek?

	She turns back, suffering in her eyes. Hesitates.

					PERRIN
			If it were anyone else... I would
			never permit it.

	A beat as she looks into his eyes. Deciding --

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT ONE     10.

8    CONTINUED: (3)

					PERRIN
			But you are a part of him... and
			he of you...

	And on Picard's reaction...

8A   INT. CARGO BAY

	Riker and GEORDI stand looking over an unusual scene.
	Spread out on the floor of the bay are fragments of
	metal -- big, small, irregular, symmetrical, most of
	them charred and twisted beyond recognition.
	SUPERNUMERARIES, with tricorders, scanners, etc. are
	moving the fragments around, trying to arrange them
	into a cohesive pattern. In evidence are the broken
	remains of the containers which once housed the
	fragments.

					RIKER
			The Vulcans can't figure out what
			these fragments are... but
			they've identified the metal as
			a dentarium alloy.

					GEORDI
			That pretty well indicates
			that they're Vulcan...
				(beat)
			And dentarium also means that
			whatever this was, it was designed
			for use in space.

	A beat as he inspects various pieces...

					GEORDI
			From the look of the damage,
			must've been a high-speed impact.

					RIKER
				(acknowledges)
			A Ferengi cargo shuttle that went
			down in the Hanolin asteroid
			belt... the debris was spread over
			one hundred square kilometers.

	Riker and Geordi pick their way through the strange
	assortment of metal chunks. Riker picks up part of
	a damaged container. Geordi picks up a metal fragment,
	plays his tricorder on it.

    STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE    10A.

8A   CONTINUED:

					GEORDI
			Could it be a weapons array?

					RIKER
			That was my first thought. But
			the Vulcans don't have any record
			of stolen weapons. Or stolen
			parts, for that matter.

	Geordi surveys the mess, shaking his head.

					GEORDI
			This is gonna be like putting
			together a big jig-saw puzzle when
			you don't know what the picture
			is supposed to be.

	Riker acknowledges and as both men begin to seek a way
	to organize the wreckage...

9    OMITTED

10   INT. SAREK'S CEREMONIAL DEATH CHAMBER

	Sarek rests on a raised bed in an otherwise Spartan
	room. His head, resting on a pillow, is turned toward
	sunlight. Tears have coursed a pattern on his face
	and dried in rivulets. His mouth moves faintly, but
	no sound emerges. Perrin and Picard stand at the
	doorway, Picard noticeably shocked by this
	deterioration in Sarek's condition.

					PERRIN
			He's like this most of the time...
			his emotions have taken over.

	She moves toward the bed, followed by Picard. Sarek's
	lips keep moving.

					PERRIN
			Sometimes I can bring him out of
			it.

	She reaches the bed, leans in to her husband. When
	she speaks it is sharply, harshly, demandingly.

					PERRIN
			Sarek! You will listen!

	Sarek snarls in rage, anger suddenly replacing pathos.

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     11.

10   CONTINUED:

					SAREK
			Go from me!

					PERRIN
			Picard is here.

	In reply, Sarek pounds his fists on the bed.

					SAREK
			No -- more -- chaos!

	Perrin turns to Picard.

					PERRIN
			I'll leave you alone. He'll
			either acknowledge you... or he
			won't.

	He nods and she EXITS. Picard is alone with the
	furious man. He takes his cue from Perrin, and speaks
	firmly, authoritatively.

					PICARD
			Sarek, I have come a long way to
			see you.

					SAREK
			I will not answer -- !

					PICARD
			I must speak to you about your
			son...

					SAREK
			I want no one with me --

					PICARD
			About Spock.

	Sarek suddenly goes silent. He doesn't look at Picard,
	and there is no indication that he truly understands.
	But then his head slowly turns, his eyes focus on
	Picard. When he speaks, his voice is quiet.

					SAREK
			Spock?

					PICARD
			Yes. He's missing.

	A flicker in Sarek's eyes as he moves into the reality
	of the present, recognition dawning.

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     12.

10   CONTINUED: (2)

					SAREK
			Is that you, Picard... ?

					PICARD
			Yes, my friend.

					SAREK
			You came here... to Vulcan...

					PICARD
			I need your help. I must find
			Spock.

	Tears spring to Sarek's eyes as his emotions overcome
	him once more. He lets out a sob, then struggles for
	the precious control that is so elusive.

					SAREK
			He is not here...

					PICARD
			I know. He is reported on
			Romulus.

	Sarek fixes him with a hard look. He is trying to
	regain control, concentrate on the moment, even though
	it costs him considerable effort.

					SAREK
			On Romulus... why?

					PICARD
			That's what I hope to find out
			from you.

					SAREK
			On Romulus...

	He is silent for a moment, musing. When he looks at
	Picard again, his eyes are clear.

					SAREK
			You're going there, aren't you?
			To find him.

					PICARD
			Yes.

	Sarek rises now, sits upright. It is as though purpose
	has given him focus.

10   CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD
			Have you any idea what might have
			taken him to Romulus?

					SAREK
			No.

					PICARD
			Is there anyone on Romulus that
			he might know... or choose to
			contact?

	A vague memory stirs for Sarek.

					SAREK
			Pardek...

					PICARD
			Who is Pardek?

					SAREK
			It could be Pardek...

					PICARD
			Who is Pardek?

	Sarek gets out of bed. He is becoming energized.

					SAREK
			He is a Romulan Senator. Spock
			has maintained a relationship with
			him over the years... I don't know
			where they met. The Khitomer
			Conference, I'd imagine.

					PICARD
			Pardek represented Romulus?

					SAREK
			Yes... yes I'm quite sure he
			did...

	He begins to pace. He is suffused with energy, leonine
	and magnificent...

    STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE    13A.

10   CONTINUED: (4)

					SAREK
			... in fact I recall Spock coming
			to me with optimism about a
			continuing dialogue with the
			Romulans at one point... and I
			told him it was clearly an
			illogical expectation... Spock
			is always so impressionable...
			this Romulan Pardek had no support
			at home... and of course in the
			end, I was proven correct.

	He looks at Picard, shrugs as though to say, "How do
	you tell a child what to do?"

					SAREK
			I tried to give him the benefit
			of experience, of logic... but
			he never listened. He never
			listened...

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT ONE     14.

10   CONTINUED: (5)

	Now Sarek has lost the train of thought, and,
	disoriented, turns away. Picard tries to get his
	attention.

					PICARD
			It has been suggested... that
			Spock may have defected.

	Sarek turns back, puzzled. He has lost the context.

					SAREK
			Never. I can accept many things,
			but not that.

					PICARD
			But you believe he might be there
			to see Pardek...

					SAREK
				(puzzled)
			The Romulan Senator? How do you
			know Pardek?

					PICARD
				(not worth going into)
			I've heard of him.

					SAREK
			That's what he's done. Gone to
			see Pardek.

	Sarek returns to the bed... exhausted now...

					PICARD
			Do you know what business they
			could have together?

					SAREK
			No.
				(beat)
			I never knew what Spock was doing.
			When he was a boy, he would
			disappear for days into the
			mountains.

					SAREK (cont'd)
			I asked him where he had gone,
			what he had done... he refused
			to answer. I insisted he tell
			me... but he would not. I forbade
			him to go... he ignored me. I
			punished him... he endured it
			silently. And always, he returned
			to the mountains.
				(beat)
			One might as well tell the river
			not to flow...

	Sarek seeks Picard's eyes... he is beginning to lose
	his control... tears overwhelm him...

					SAREK
			Secretly... I admired him... that
			proud core of him that would not
			yield...

	A beat.

					PICARD
				(softly)
			Sarek, we are a part of each
			other. I know Spock has caused
			you pain... but I also know you
			love him...

	Tears are threatening to overwhelm Sarek.

					SAREK
			Tell him, Picard...

	His eyes begin to glaze over slightly, and he struggles
	to maintain control for a moment longer. He looks
	toward one of his hands, and tries to form his fingers
	in the Vulcan salute... the fingers won't obey. They
	tremble and shift position and just won't go where they
	should. Gently, Picard reaches over and puts them
	right. Sarek smiles and holds the hand toward him.
	Picard then forms the salute himself.

					PICARD
			Peace and long life, Sarek.

			Live long and... and...
				(beat)
			... live long and...

	He drifts off vaguely, his hands losing the salute and
	his mind losing reality. He turns away, his mind
	elsewhere.

					SAREK
			Spock... my son...

	Picard watches sadly as Sarek cries.

					PICARD
				(whispering)

	Close on Picard at tactical. On the heels of his

	flabbergasted...

					PICARD
			Still no response from the
			Klingons, Mister Worf?

					WORF
			Nossir.

	Picard looks incredulously at Riker at command.

					PICARD
			He's ignoring me... what other
			explanation is there?

					RIKER
			Seems like, after three days of
			hailing him, he could've found
			a minute to talk to you...

					WORF
			Sir...

					PICARD
				(rather snappish)
			Yes, Lieutenant?

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT TWO     18.

13   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			I believe I know why our messages
			are not being answered. Gowron...
			has been rewriting Klingon
			history.

					RIKER
			Rewriting history?

					WORF
			He is claiming that it was his
			courage... his genius... which
			brought about an end to the civil
			war.

					PICARD
			I see.

					WORF
			In the new version... there is
			no mention made of the
			Federation's help in his rise to
			power.

					RIKER
			If Worf's right, our arrival
			would be an uncomfortable
			reminder of the facts...

					PICARD
			Victors re-write the history
			books. He can take every bit of
			credit, I'll gladly grant him
			that. But I need a ship.
				(frowns, a beat)
			If Gowron won't talk to me... get
			somebody who will, somebody on
			the High Council, K'Tal perhaps...

					WORF
			Yes, Captain.

	Picard exchanges another frustrated glance with
	Riker...

	Picard moves back to join Data at the monitor.
	Picard sits near him. On the monitor is newsreel-type
	photo-op coverage, handshaking and so forth...

					DATA
			This is a Barolian record of a

			participated four years ago...

	It ends...

					PICARD
			That's all?

					DATA
			Yessir.

					PICARD
			Run it again.

	Data presses some panels, Picard studies it silently
	for a beat... hits a panel and freezes it on the best

					PICARD
			Call up the intelligence

	Data presses some panels...

13B  ANGLE (OPTICAL)

	The shot of Spock appears... another man who is with

					PICARD (o.c.)
			Same man... Pardek...

13C  RESUME

					PICARD
			One question answered.
				(beat)
			What do we know of him?

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT TWO     20.

13C  CONTINUED:

					DATA
			He has been in public service
			since he was a young man... a
			senator for nine decades. He is
			considered a "man of the
			people... " He has sponsored many
			reforms. Reportedly, he is
			considered by the Romulan
			leadership to be something of a
			radical because he has been an
			advocate for peace throughout his
			career.

					PICARD
				(nods)
			I can see why Spock would
			cultivate a relationship with him.

					DATA
			Yessir.

					PICARD
			Where are we likely to find him
			-- other than on the floor of the
			Romulan Senate?

					DATA
			The district he represents is
			called the Krocton Segment. He
			maintains a dwelling there.

	Picard nods, absorbing all this, musing on it.

					PICARD
			Very good, Mister Data.

	Picard begins to rise...

					DATA
			There is more, sir... I took the
			liberty of expanding the
			perameters of my search... and
			have discovered that Pardek has
			several relatives in the Krocton
			Segment. It is likely that you
			will be able to locate him there
			on the third day of the Romulan

					DATA
			Thank you, sir.

					PICARD
			If I ever get to Romulus, Data,
			I am going to need help. I'd like
			you to accompany me.

					DATA
			To the surface, sir?

					PICARD
			Yes...

	Data is flattered, but puzzled...

					DATA
			I understand how you can be made
			to look Romulan, but I believe
			it will be more difficult to
			transform an android, Captain.

					PICARD
			I think Doctor Crusher can come
			up with something...

					WORF
			Captain... we are being hailed
			by the Klingon Home World.

	Picard moves toward him.

					PICARD
			Gowron or K'Tal?

					WORF
			Neither, sir... it is the junior

			delegation.

	Picard frowns...

					RIKER
			Junior adjutant.

	Appearing on the viewscreen is a Klingon, B'IJIK --

	to say "no," but never "yes."

					B'IJIK
			Greetings, Captain. I regret to
			inform you that Gowron and the
			High Council are quite busy and
			won't be able to speak with you
			today.

					PICARD
			Is he aware that we've been
			transmitting messages for three
			days?

					B'IJIK
				(feigned surprise)
			Messages? I'll have to inspect
			the logs... but I'm sure we
			haven't received any...

					PICARD
			It is of the utmost importance
			that I speak with Gowron...

					B'IJIK
			Captain, Gowron wishes it were
			possible to talk with everyone
			who wants an audience. But he
			is one man... the demands on his
			time are formidable. If you would
			like me to take him a message...

					PICARD
			A message. Very well.

	He moves toward the viewscreen.

					PICARD
			Tell Gowron, Leader of the High
			Council of the Klingon Empire,
			that his Arbiter of Succession,
			Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favor.

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT TWO     23.

14   CONTINUED:

					B'IJIK
			A favor?

					PICARD
			I require a cloaked vessel.

					B'IJIK
				(faint smile)
			A cloaked vessel. This is no
			small favor, Captain.

					PICARD
			It is for a mission that could
			have repercussions throughout the
			quadrant.

					B'IJIK
			How would it benefit the Klingon
			Empire? I'm sure Gowron will
			ask...

	Picard studies him a long beat. Dry...

					PICARD
			The only benefit to the Klingon
			Empire... would be our gratitude.

					B'IJIK
			That's what you want me to tell
			Gowron... .?

					PICARD
			Yes. And please add that if he
			is unable to provide a ship, I
			am sure there are others in the
			Klingon Empire who would be
			willing to help me. And then they
			would have our gratitude.

	That hangs in the air for a second.

					B'IJIK
			I see.

     STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT TWO     24.

14   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			Also please tell him that I am

			prospering so well. It is a

	B'ijik inclines his head, and the screen returns to

					BEVERLY
			They aren't removable, are they,

					DATA
			Removable, Doctor?

					BEVERLY
			Your ears.

					DATA
			No, Doctor... they are fully

14C  CONTINUED:

					BEVERLY
			We'll have to do some tests with

			afterwards.

	She takes a set of optical calipers from a stand and
	measures Picard's head... as Riker ENTERS... intrigued
	by these proceedings...

					BEVERLY
			The right eye is point-zero-zero-

			It is not...

					BEVERLY
			You want a proper fit on your

				(re: the eyes)
			I won't tell a soul, sir.

					PICARD
			Anything from Gowron?

					RIKER
			Nosir. But after your tailor is
			done, would you join me in the

			Or at least what's left of one.

			Why would anyone want a Vulcan

					GEORDI
			Beats me, Commander. Every

			bring up two more.

					PICARD

			Yes, sir. A metallurgical

					K'VADA
			When I received my orders... I

	No response from Picard.

			You think information like that

	Picard regards him evenly.

					PICARD
			Your orders are to take us to a

			It may not be what you're used

	Picard and Data look around the quarters to see --

19   THE ROOM - THEIR POV

	A bleak, uncomfortable room, Spartan in its
	furnishings; the bed is a shelf recessed in the wall;
	it is dark, dingy, and gives the impression of a place
	that has been unused for years.

					PICARD
			Quite nice. Thank you.

	Picard knows that K'Vada is spoiling for a fight...
	and he sees nothing to gain by giving him one. His
	refusal to be drawn in becomes increasingly frustrating

			Surplus Depot Zed-One-Five.

					RIKER
			We need some information about
			a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau. It was
			sent there a few years ago.

					DOKACHIN
			Did you arrange an appointment?

	Riker looks a bit startled.

					RIKER
			Appointment... no...

					DOKACHIN
			Then I will be unable to help you.
			You may communicate with
			scheduling.

	And the transmission goes back to starfield. Riker is
	nonplussed. He turns to Troi.

					RIKER
			Who does he think he is?

					TROI
			The quartermaster of the surplus
			yard, Commander. With information
			you need.

	He eyes her a moment, gets her point.

					RIKER
			Right. Mister Worf...
			reestablish communication.

					WORF
			Yes, sir.

23   CONTINUED: (2)

	A second, and then Dokachin appears on the screen once
	more, surprised at being interrupted again.

					RIKER
			Mister Dokaychin...

					DOKACHIN
			Dokahchin... Klim Dokahchin...

					RIKER
			Mister Dokahchin, the information
			I need involves a matter of major
			importance to the Federation.

					DOKACHIN
				(unimpressed)
			Uh huh.

					RIKER
			I'll need access to your logs,
			your files...
				(beat - no answer)
			It won't take long. My people
			can do the work.

					DOKACHIN
			I don't allow outsiders into my
			computer system.

					RIKER
			Fine. One of your people, then.

					DOKACHIN
			I wish I had the people to spare.
			I don't.

	Riker is starting to get steamed.

					RIKER
			Well, sir... what would you
			suggest?

					DOKACHIN
			I don't know. Contact me when
			you reach orbit.

	And the starfield returns once more. Riker turns to
	Troi.

    STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT THREE 33A-34.       

23   CONTINUED: (3)

					RIKER
				(incredulous)
			I don't believe him.

					TROI
			He's king of his particular hill,
			Commander. You'll have to treat
			him that way.

					RIKER
			Counselor... a perfect job for
			you.

	He sits, happy to relinquish this task to Troi.

24   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE AND DEPOT (OPTICAL)

	The Enterprise approaches a vast surplus depot of old,
	abandoned, and decommissioned vessels... stretching as
	far as the eye can see... a graveyard of once proud
	ships from throughout the Federation.

25   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

	Riker, Geordi, and Troi are standing at an aft science
	station as the turbolift opens and Worf and Dokachin
	ENTER. Dokachin scrutinizes the entire bridge. Riker
	is trying his hardest to be gracious.

					RIKER
			Thank you for coming on board,
			Mister Dokachin.

	Dokachin is still rubber-necking.

					DOKACHIN
			Quite a ship you have.

					RIKER
			We've tied into your computers.
			If you could access the files...

					DOKACHIN
			I don't usually see them in such
			good condition. By the time they
			get to me, they're always falling
			apart.

	Riker appeals to Troi with his eyes, and she moves
	toward Dokachin.

    STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT THREE    35.

25   CONTINUED:

					TROI
			Mister Dokachin, we must find this
			ship -- and you're the only one
			who can help us.

	He turns, looks at her, and is caught in spite of
	himself by her gently stroking demeanor.

					DOKACHIN
			Who're you?

					TROI
			Deanna Troi, Ship's Counselor.

	He nods, without looking at Riker, talking about him...

					DOKACHIN
			He probably figures we don't get
			to see a lot of handsome women
			out this way -- and someone like
			you might get a little more
			cooperation from me.

	Troi and Riker exchange a glance. A beat.

					DOKACHIN
			He's probably right.

	He moves to a console.

					DOKACHIN
			What was the name of that ship?
			The T'Pau?
				(keying instructions)
			The T'Pau... Vulcan registry...
				(gesturing)
			There. Logged in on stardate
			41334.

					GEORDI
			Where is the ship now?

	Dokachin is still resistant; he doesn't give up
	information easily.

					DOKACHIN
			Docked.
				(off Riker's look)
			Section eighteen-gamma-twelve.
			Do you want me to take you there?

   STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT THREE   35A.

					RIKER
			I'd appreciate that.

					DOKACHIN
				(the Captain)
			Helmsman, lay in a heading
			one-four-one by two-zero-eight.
			Ahead slow, two hundred kph.

	Riker nods to the helmsman, go ahead. Dokachin turns
	to Troi...

					DOKACHIN
			I suppose this is your first time
			in a junkyard, isn't it? You'd
			be surprised at some of the things
			I find on board these ships...

	Troi listens in rapt attention...

25A  EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	as it makes its way through the graveyard of ships.

25B  INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE

	As before. Troi is seated near Dokachin, trying to
	keep a glazed expression off her face as Dokachin warms
	to his favorite subject.

					DOKACHIN
			I once found a fourteen foot
			Caldorian eel on board a
			freighter... in someone's
			locker...

					TROI
			Are you serious?

					DOKACHIN
			If you have time, I'll show it
			to you... I still have it...

			On screen.

26   ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	A starfield -- empty space. The group reacts with
	puzzlement; Dokachin is caught completely off guard.
	He takes a step toward the screen, nonplussed.

					DOKACHIN
			Where is it? What happened to
			it?

	He glances at Riker who has no answers... he turns
	back, taps keys.

					DOKACHIN
			These are the correct
			coordinates...

					RIKER
			The T'Pau is missing?

					DOKACHIN
			The T'Pau...
				(a beat)
			... is missing.

					RIKER
			How could a ship disappear from
			your depot?

	Dokachin seems to be chastened. This is embarrassing
	for him.

    STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT THREE    37.

26   CONTINUED:

	He turns back to his console, bristling with intent.

					DOKACHIN
			I'm not accustomed to losing
			things, Commander. I'll find your
			ship for you.
				(as he furiously works
				 the keys)
			I have the T'Pau cross-referenced
			in four different directories...

					GEORDI
			When it was brought here... was
			it stripped of materiel --
			armament, sensors... ?

					DOKACHIN
				(still working)
			Of course...

					GEORDI
			Can you tell us what happened
			to its navigational deflector?

	Dokachin looks at the monitor.

					DOKACHIN
			It was routed to the Tripoli, a
			holding vessel on the outer rim
			of the shipyard.

					RIKER
			It's not there anymore. What's
			left of that deflector is laid
			out on the floor of our cargo bay.

	Dokachin is stricken. His system, his efficiency,
	everything he stands for is under assault.

					DOKACHIN
			How can that be?

					RIKER
			Maybe we ought to pay a visit to
			the Tripoli...

	Off Dokachin's reaction...

					DOKACHIN
			In all the time the Zakdorn have

			tell you this... somebody will
			pay. I'll conduct an
			investigation. Whoever is
			responsible...

					WORF
			Approaching the coordinates of

	Riker exchanges a look with Dokachin, who now looks
	visibly nervous.

					RIKER
			On screen.

26C  ANGLE - VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	Again, the starfield. Empty space. Dokachin is
	devastated.

					DOKACHIN
			I do not understand this. This
			is not possible.

	He turns to the others, as though to prove that the
	missing ship is in fact where it should be.

					DOKACHIN
			We beam goods to the Tripoli on
			a regular schedule. There was
			a shipment yesterday, and another
			is set for today. It must be
			there.

					RIKER
			When is today's transport?

 STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - REV. 9/16/91 - ACT THREE 38A.

26C  CONTINUED:

					DOKACHIN
			Just over two hours from now.
			A shipment of deuterium storage
			tanks.

					RIKER
			Ensign, align the Enterprise so
			we'll appear to be one of the
			abandoned ships. Mister La Forge,
			when we're in position, shut down
			engines and all systems except
			sensors and life support.

					GEORDI
			Aye, sir.

	Riker starts for his chair.

					RIKER
			I'm guessing somebody's going to
			be here to receive those storage

27   INT. KLINGON BIRD OF PREY - QUARTERS

	Picard and Data surveying the room.

					DATA
			These quarters were obviously
			intended for only one crewmember,
			sir. There is a single sleeping
			space.

					PICARD
			I'm sure the Klingons found it
			amusing to put us together in
			here.

					DATA
			Since I do not require sleep, I
			propose you take the --
				(not sure what to call
				 the hole in the wall)
			-- shelf. I will be content to
			stand.

					PICARD
			Very well, Mister Data. Thank
			you.

	Picard maneuvers past him toward the shelf in the wall,
	eyes it. It is truly unappealing. With resignation,
	he crawls into it -- an ungainly and difficult
	proceeding. He finally accomplishes the task and finds
	himself lying on his back staring at the top of the
	shelf not far from his eyes.

					DATA
			Are you comfortable, sir?

					PICARD
			I suppose so.

					DATA
			Good-night, Captain. Sleep well.

					PICARD
			Thank you.

	And he closes his eyes and tries to block it all out.
	Data zones out -- concentrating on something.


         STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT FOUR        40.

27   CONTINUED:

	Picard holds his eyes shut for a moment, then opens
	them, rolls his head toward Data.

					PICARD
			What are you doing?

					DATA
			Sir? Was I making noise?

					PICARD
			Not exactly...

					DATA
			I was processing the information
			we have accumulated on Romulan
			society. I am preparing for the
			task of impersonating a Romulan.

					PICARD
			I see.

					DATA
			Would you like me to discontinue?

					PICARD
			No, no. Please go ahead.

	And he shuts his eyes again. Holds them shut... then
	opens them again. He sees Data staring right at him.

					PICARD
			What are you looking at?

					DATA
			I am not looking at anything, sir.
			I am continuing to organize my
			files.

					PICARD
			But you're looking at me.

					DATA
			I am sorry if I am disturbing you,

	And he turns so that the back of his head is toward
	Picard.

27   CONTINUED: (2)

	Picard tries to get comfortable, closes his eyes again.
	He lies like that for a moment, then... crawls out of
	bed.

					DATA
			Sir, do you not wish to sleep?

					PICARD
			I don't think so. Shall we
			continue to go over the files?

					DATA
			I would be happy to.
				(launching in without
				 further ado)
			I have been studying the Krocton
			Segment, as you asked, and have
			selected an appropriate site for
			our transport...

	He is interrupted by --

					K'VADA'S COM VOICE
			Captain K'Vada to Picard... please
			come to the bridge.

	Picard and Data exchange glances, and then EXIT.

					GEORDI
			Sensors indicate a combat

				(continuing)
			The tenor of our mission has

					DATA
			I am afraid I do not entirely
			understand, sir. As a Vulcan,
			would not Ambassador Spock simply
			see death as a logical result of
			his father's illness... ?

					PICARD
			It is never quite that simple.
			Not even for a Vulcan. Certainly
			not for Spock who is also half
			Human.
				(beat)
			They spent a lifetime in

				(processing this)
			Considering the exceptionally long

			And then the time comes when it

	are joyless, grim, hurrying along without interacting
	with each other. There is the feeling that life is
	difficult here, and everyone pretty much looks out for
	himself.

	Picard and Data ENTER, talking quietly, looking around.
	There are other small clumps of people doing so... they
	reflect the same dismal expressions as the Romulans...
	not making eye contact.

					DATA
			This is definitely the street on
			which the intelligence scan
			of Spock and Pardek was taken,
			sir... adjusting for the optical
			distortion, I am able to verify
			the architectural features...

					PICARD
			Where were they standing?

	Data does some processing, scanning the street, with a
	few android movements... a few people glance at them,
	Picard reacts... puts his arm around Data's shoulder,
	smiles, in a friendly pose for the sake of onlookers...
	sotto --

					PICARD
			Data...

					DATA
			Sir?

      STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - REV. 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE     50A.

37   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			You're moving about in a very...
			well, android manner...

					DATA
			I am sorry, Captain. I will be
			more careful.

					PICARD
			And don't call me "Captain."

					DATA
			Yes, Cap --
				(cutting himself off)
			I understand.
				(looks around)
			I have located the place where
			they were standing...

	Picard breaks the arm contact.

					PICARD
			Where?

	Now, Data puts his arm around Picard's shoulder, as
	Picard reacts, leading him a few doorways away...

					DATA
			It is here --
				(gestures)
			-- at this doorway.

	There is a small Romulan sign near the door. (Data
	drops his arm.) Reading...

					DATA
			A legal intercessor's office...
			the name is similar to Pardek's.
			It would appear to be one of
			his relatives.

	Picard tries the door; it is locked.

					PICARD
			Not open for business yet...

					DATA
			Nevertheless, it would be my
			recommendation that we keep this
			location under observation.

         STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE       50B.

37   CONTINUED: (2)

					DATA (cont'd)
			I have clearly determined
			Pardek's routine. On days when
			the Senate is not in session, he
			invariably comes to this section
			after the median hour.

	Picard looks around, sizing up the situation. He sees
	tables, people eating -- a kind of "cafe."

					PICARD
			Very well, why don't we take the
			opportunity to try some of the
			local cuisine...

	The two saunter toward the cafe, passing some ROMULAN
	FOOTSOLDIERS as they do. (One of these is ROMULAN #1
	from Part II.) Picard and Data keep their eyes
	straight ahead.

      STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - REV. 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE      51.

37A  ANGLE - AT CAFE

	They move to stand, like others, at a table. A WOMAN
	appears before them... rather dour-looking, with hard,
	suspicious eyes.

					DATA
			What do you recommend?

					SOUP WOMAN
			Soup.

					DATA
			That sounds very appealing. I
			will have soup.

	The woman looks at Picard.

					PICARD
			Soup is fine.

	She moves off to get the soup. Picard and Data glance
	around, trying to get a sense of how they're fitting
	in.

37A  THE FOOTSOLDIERS

	are standing nearby.

37A  PICARD AND DATA

	as the woman returns and places two bowls of soup in
	front of them.

					PICARD
				(friendly)
			Do you happen to know what time
			the intercessor's office across
			the way opens?

					SOUP WOMAN
			Why do you want to know?

					PICARD
				(reacts)
			I need his services... he was
			recommended.

					SOUP WOMAN
				(beat)
			I haven't seen you here before.

         STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE       51A.

37AB	CONTINUED:

					DATA
			We are here for the day... from
			the city of Rateg.

					SOUP WOMAN
			Rateg. I don't think so.

					DATA
			Why do you say that?

					SOUP WOMAN
			You don't sound like you're from
			Rateg.

					DATA
			It is a misconception that all
			Rategs speak with a particular
			inflection. In fact, there are
			twelve different --

					PICARD
				(interrupting)
			We come from several kilometers
			outside the city...

					SOUP WOMAN
				(studies them a beat)
			Or perhaps you come from the
			security forces, to watch the
			intercessor's office. Is he in
			trouble?

					PICARD
			Madam, you are mistaken.

					SOUP WOMAN
			It doesn't matter to me. I don't
			know when he opens. Eat your
			soup. Courtesy of a loyal
			establishment. Jolan True.

	She leaves. Picard looks around. It is unnerving to
	be in the midst of the Romulan city, surrounded by
	enemies. Data, of course, has no such apprehensions,
	and continues to eat his soup. As Picard works on the
	distasteful broth, he looks up to see --

37B  THE FOOTSOLDIERS

	who have been looking at them, but quickly look away.

         STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE       51B.

37C  PICARD AND DATA

	Picard begins eating again, and tries to keep from
	looking at the soldiers.

					PICARD
			We can't stay here long.

	Data glances up and reacts --

					DATA
			We may not have to... Direct your
			view to the far corner... is that
			not Pardek?

38
thru	OMITTED
43

44   CLOSE ON PARDEK

	who has just entered the area, and moving to talk with
	two other Romulan civilians.

         STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/17/91 - ACT FIVE        52.

45   ANGLE - PICARD AND DATA

	having seen him.

					PICARD
			I believe you're right...

	Picard pauses in his soup eating to watch Pardek...

	Data glances over to see...

45A  OMITTED

45B  THE FOOTSOLDIERS

	staring right at them.

45C  PICARD AND DATA

					DATA
				(quietly)
			Perhaps you should appear to
			enjoy your soup.

	Picard reacts, begins to eat again...

45D  THE ROMULAN FOOTSOLDIERS

	have moved into the cafe, and stand chatting casually.

45E  PICARD AND DATA

	continue to watch Pardek.

46   PARDEK

	bids farewell to his colleagues and starts down the
	street.

47   PICARD AND DATA

	casually put down their bowls of soup and turn to move
	after Pardek. But --

      STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - REV. 9/16/91 - ACT FIVE     52A.

48
thru	OMITTED
55

56   THE SOLDIERS

	block their way, disruptors drawn.

					ROMULAN#1
			Do not move.

	Picard and Data stop, eyeing the weapons.

					PICARD
			What? You've made a mistake...

					ROMULAN#1
			Quiet. Come with us...

	The soldiers grab their quarry in a firm grip and,
	holding the disruptors at their backs, move them up
	the street and around the corner.

         STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT FIVE        53.

57   INT. ROMULAN CAVES - A LITTLE LATER

	The two soldiers push Picard and Data along ahead of
	them.

					ROMULAN#1
			Wait here.

					PICARD
			For what? Why have you brought
			us here?

	A movement from the cavern entrance; all turn toward
	it... and in walks Pardek.

					PARDEK
			Welcome to Romulus, Captain
			Picard.

	He gestures toward the "Romulan soldiers" who have
	begun stripping off their uniforms -- revealing
	civilian clothing underneath.

					PARDEK
			Don't let our "soldiers" alarm
			you... we had to get you off the
			streets quickly. Romulan security
			knows you are here.

	Picard casts a glance around the room. He's not
	certain who these people are... whether he can trust
	them...

					PARDEK
				(reassuring)
			I am Pardek... you are among
			friends, Captain.

	Picard knows he must take a chance.

					PICARD
			I have come on an urgent mission
			from the Federation. I am looking
			for Ambassador Spock.

					VOICE (o.c.)
			Indeed...

	All heads turn toward the sound. It comes from deep
	shadows within the cave.

         STAR TREK: "Unification" Pt. I - 9/13/91 - ACT FIVE        54.

57   CONTINUED:

	The group is silent... then, the sound of footsteps
	echoes on the cave floor... from a long way... moving
	ever closer, the plock-plock ringing loud in the
	silence of the cave, the echoes swelling as the
	footsteps approach... now we see --

58   OMITTED

59   A SHADOWY FIGURE

	beginning to emerge. He moves closer, closer... his
	bearing regal, poised...

	But his face is still in darkness... finally he steps
	out into the light... and we see the unmistakable
	visage of SPOCK.

	When he speaks, there is no warmth to his voice, and
	his eyes are cold. He is not happy to see Picard.

					SPOCK
			You have found him, Captain
			Picard.

	And on the various reactions --

									SUPERIMPOSE:

				"TO BE CONTINUED"

									FADE OUT.

	FADE IN:

1    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	at warp speed.

					PICARD (V.O.)
			Captain's log, stardate 45333.3.
			The Enterprise is on its way to
			Penthara Four where a type C
			asteroid has struck an unpopulated
			continent.

2    INT. GEORDI'S OFFICE

	NUMEROUS ENGINEERING CREW are busily working with
	GEORDI and DATA.

					PICARD (V.O.)
				(continuing)
			The resulting dust cloud could
			very well create a phenomenon not
			unlike the nuclear winters of
			twenty-first-century Earth.
			Commander La Forge has begun work
			on a plan that would counteract
			the devastation.

	Geordi looks over as RIKER ENTERS.

					GEORDI
			I'm afraid the numbers coming in
			are already indicating climatic
			changes, sir.

					RIKER
			What kind of drop can we expect?

					DATA
			If the Pentharan spheral forecasts
			are correct, ten to twelve degrees
			Celsius within the first ten days.

    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - TEASER    2.

2    CONTINUED:

					GEORDI
			If it continues like that, their
			entire ecosystem will be shot
			to hell.

					RIKER
			And I doubt they're prepared to
			cope with the kind of cold that's
			coming.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Commander Riker.

					RIKER
				(keys combadge)
			Yes, Captain.

					PICARD'S COM VOICE
			Would you join me on the bridge,
			please.

					RIKER
			On my way.
				(to guys)
			Let me know if those forecast
			numbers change.

	Geordi and Data acknowledge as Riker EXITS.

3    INT. BRIDGE

	PICARD, WORF, AN ENSIGN at theconn, and SUPERNUMERARIES
	at various stations.

					PICARD
			Are you certain, Worf?

					WORF
			There was a space/time
			distortion, sir. And there is
			something back there. We passed
			within three hundred kilometers
			of it.

					PICARD
			A bit close for coincidence.
				(to com)
			Mister La Forge?

					GEORDI'S COM VOICE
			Yes, sir.

      STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - 9/20/91 - TEASER      3.

3    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			Would a delay of an hour affect
			your plans?

									INTERCUT:

4    INT. GEORDI'S OFFICE

					GEORDI
			Not unless another asteroid
			decides to pay a call on Penthara,
			sir.

					DATA
			The odds of that occurring,
			Captain, are extremely unlikely,
			given the time frame.

5    INT. BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

	as Riker ENTERS.

					PICARD
			Thank you, Mister Data.
				(to Ensign)
			Prepare to come about, Ensign.
			Let's take a look at Mister Worf's
			distortion.

					ENSIGN
			Aye, sir.

					RIKER
			Mister Worf's what?

					PICARD
			The Lieutenant's sensors detected
			a temporal distortion, Number One,
			almost directly on our current
			course. There seems to be a small
			object back there that wasn't
			there a few moments ago.

	On Riker and Picard's mutual curiosity...

6    EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	comes out of warp and makes a sweeping turn.

    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - TEASER    4.

7    INT. BRIDGE (OPTICAL)

	As before.

					WORF
			The object is fifty kilometers
			ahead, sir.

					PICARD
			Full stop, Ensign.

					ENSIGN
			Aye, sir.

					PICARD
			On screen.

	A view of a tiny multifaceted spacecraft appears.

					RIKER
			Dimensions, Worf?

					WORF
			Approximately five meters in
			length, sir.

					PICARD
			Lifesigns?

					WORF
			No signs of any kind, sir.
			Sensors are not penetrating its
			hull.

					PICARD
			Try hailing it.

					WORF
				(pushes a series
				 of buttons)
			That's odd.

					RIKER
			What's odd?

					WORF
			We've received a response, sir,
			but...

					PICARD
				(get on with it)
			Yes, Mister Worf?

    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - TEASER    5.

7    CONTINUED:

					WORF
			They want you to... "Move over,"
			sir.

					PICARD
				(looks at Riker and then
				 back at Worf)
			Reply that the Enterprise isn't
			going anywhere, Lieutenant.

					WORF
			Not the Enterprise, Captain. You.

	Picard turns and walks toward Worf.

					PICARD
			What are you trying to...

	Suddenly there's a bright flash where Picard had been
	standing. RASMUSSEN, a kindly-looking human male in
	his late forties, APPEARS. He is wearing a drab,
	nondescript jump suit and a baggy "lab" jacket. He
	carries a small valise.

					RASMUSSEN
			Excuse me, Captain, but you were
			standing right where I needed to
			be.

					PICARD
			Who are you?

					RASMUSSEN
			Rasmussen's the name, sir.
			Professor Berlinghoff Rasmussen.
				(looking around in
				 amazement)
			Ah... this is wonderful.
			Actually, quite a bit larger than
			I thought.

					PICARD
			Really?

					RASMUSSEN
			Where I come from, every historian
			knows the bridge of old 1701-D.

					PICARD
			And where exactly is it you come
			from?

      STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - 9/20/91 - TEASER      6.

7    CONTINUED: (2)

					RASMUSSEN
			Why Earth... late twenty-sixth
			century Earth, to be exact. You
			see, I've traveled back nearly
			three hundred years just to find
			you.

	Off their reactions we...

									FADE OUT.

8    INT. READY ROOM

	Picard sits behind his desk while Rasmussen paces,
	checking things out.

					PICARD
			Exactly what kind of historian
			are you?

					RASMUSSEN
				(as he continues to
				 pace, picking things
				 up, turning them over)
			My focus is on the twenty-second 
			through the twenty-fourth centuries,
			early interstellar history.
				(picking up Picard's
				 Shakespeare volume)
			You know, it was always believed
			this was on your desk, not here...
			Fascinating.
				(he turns to Picard,
				 good naturedly)
			Now don't move it on my account.

					PICARD
			You can't expect me to believe
			that the layout of my ready room
			is of interest to future
			historians...

					RASMUSSEN
			No less so than your legendary
			modesty, Captain. I wish I could
			describe to you what a thrill it
			is to be here...
				(he stops at the
				 painting over Picard's
				 couch)
			This is the original, isn't it?

      STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - 9/20/91 - ACT ONE      8.

8    CONTINUED:

					PICARD
			You flatter me Professor, but I
			can't help but wonder what could
			possibly have caused you to select
			me as the subject of your study.
			Even in this decade, there are
			far wiser and more experienced
			Humans both in and out of
			Starfleet.

					RASMUSSEN
			I'd love to tell you, Picard.
			I really would. But try and
			imagine what a young Caesar might
			have done differently if someone
			had given him a hint of what lay
			ahead. Or, if Lincoln had been
			coerced into changing his theater
			plans. I truly wish I could be
			more specific on why you were
			selected, but I'm afraid the
			exchange of information will have
			to flow in one direction only.

	As Rasmussen talks, he walks to the door and paces out
	the distance to the window.

					RASMUSSEN
			...four... five... six... seven
			meters. HA! I was right!

	Off Picard's look...

9    INT. OBSERVATION LOUNGE

	Picard, Riker, Worf, BEVERLY, TROI, Data and Geordi.
	Rasmussen is sitting beside Picard.

					WORF
			Why now?

					GEORDI
			Right. If you came back to study
			us, to study the captain, why did
			you pick today? Why not a year
			ago... or a year from now?

					RASMUSSEN
			Oh, I picked the right day
			alright. Just wait, you'll see.
					(MORE)

   STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT ONE   9.

9    CONTINUED:

					RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
				(to Worf)
			Do you always sit there, on that
			side of the table?

					WORF
			Usually. Why?

					RASMUSSEN
				(shakes his head and
				 smiles)
			It's not important.

	Worf is starting to dislike this man.

					RIKER
			Tell me, Professor, at what point
			does time travel become a tool
			for historians?

					RASMUSSEN
			Now, now, Commander. You know
			better than that. I've studied
			a great deal about your century.
			Including the fact that you're
			all quite aware of the dangers
			of anyone altering the past. And
			that's exactly what I'd be doing
			if I were to divulge information
			like that.

					BEVERLY
			Telurian plague!

					RASMUSSEN
			I beg your pardon?

					BEVERLY
			Telurian plague... was it cured?
			I mean, has it been cured by your
			century? There can't be any harm
			in asking that.

	Rasmussen turns to Picard for help.

					PICARD
			I realize it will be difficult,
			but we must all keep our questions
			regarding the future to ourselves.

					PICARD
			He is Human. Our medical scans

					BEVERLY
			He's Human, alright.

					PICARD
			And there was a temporal

			Mister Worf?

					WORF
				(begrudgingly)
			Yes, sir.

			I appreciate your caution, Mister

					DATA
				(almost shy)
			Would I be correct, Professor,
			in assuming that you know whether
			or not I am still... alive in

	Rasmussen ignores Data. He finishes washing and holds
	out his hand, treating Data like a men's room
	attendant. After a beat, Data catches on and hands him
	a towel.

					DATA
				(continuing his line

			Since you seemed to know so much

					RASMUSSEN
			You're a very curious woman.

	Beverly reacts.

					RASMUSSEN
			No, no. I don't mean curious like
			that. I mean you're curious...
			curious about things. About
			Berylite levels... about the
			future.

	They begin to walk back toward Beverly's office.

					BEVERLY
				(smiling)
			Curiosity is why most of us are
			out here, professor.

					RASMUSSEN
			I understand. But you're
			different. More... vibrant.
			More...

	Rasmussen is fishing for a word.

					BEVERLY
			More vibrant. That's nice, I like
			that.

	They enter the vestibule outside Beverly's office.

					RASMUSSEN
			You know, whenever I... travel
			back, I meet very interesting
			people... men and women. But
			never anyone who gave me thoughts
			about not going home.

	Beverly is genuinely flattered, a bit turned-on.

					BEVERLY
			You're not supposed to be
			influencing the past, remember?
			And I'm beginning to feel a
			little... influenced. Anyway,
			I'm old enough to be your great,
			great, great, great, grandmother!

	Rasmussen smiles warmly...

32   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Picard, Riker, Data, Worf, the Ensign and other
	supernumeraries at their stations.

					PICARD
			What kind of questions did he have
			for you, Number One?

					RIKER
			All he wanted to know about was
			previous starships. What I
			thought was innovative on the
			last Enterprise or the one before
			that. He said he wanted to see
			how well we "grasped the
			fundamentals."

					DATA
			His queries to me primarily
			focused on Doctor Soong's...

	An ALARM is heard.

					WORF
			Captain, I am detecting a massive
			earthquake on the surface.

	Another ALARM is heard. Riker moves to an aft station.

					WORF
				(continuing)
			Two earthquakes, sir.

					PICARD
			Location?

					DATA
			Both epicenters are beneath the
			two southernmost drill sites,
			Captain.

					PICARD
			Is La Forge still down there?

					WORF
			Yes, sir.

					PICARD
			Find him.

	Worf starts pushing buttons on his panel. Another
	alarm is heard.

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT THREE  33.

32   CONTINUED:

					RIKER
			We've also got some volcanic
			activity... pretty severe.

					PICARD
			Magnify.

33   ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as the screen changes from a wider view of the planet
	to a closer view, we see huge volcanic plumes rising
	through the dense dust clouds.

					GEORDI'S COM VOICE
			La Forge here, Captain. Moseley
			and I are on our way back to his
			lab.

					PICARD
			Are you alright?

					GEORDI'S COM VOICE
			We're okay, but those were pretty
			big, sir. If this was Earth, I'd
			say around an eight or an eight
			five on the Richter Scale. We're
			starting to see some volcanic
			plumes, Captain.

	More alarms are heard.

34   ANOTHER ANGLE

					WORF
			Two more eruptions, sir.

					DATA
			It is most likely that we
			overestimated the geologic
			stability around the CO2 pockets.

					GEORDI'S COM VOICE
			We're in the lab, sir.

	Picard motions to Worf to put Geordi on the viewscreen.

35   ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	and we see the interior of the lab. Everyone is busy
	dealing with the emergency.

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT THREE  34.

35   CONTINUED:

					MOSELEY
			We're fairly well quake-proofed
			down here, Picard. It's the
			volcanic dust I'm worried about.

	Another jolt hits the lab.

					PICARD
				(to Moseley)
			What about the dust?

	Another jolt hits the lab.

					GEORDI
			The ash the volcanos are throwing
			into the atmosphere is going to
			compound the existing problem.
			In a matter of days, there'll be
			no sunlight getting through those
			clouds.

					MOSELEY
			And no amount of CO2 is going to
			help us then.

					RIKER
			Captain, look at this.

	Picard walks quickly to the aft station. Riker points
	to one of two maps on a monitor.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			These are the coordinates of the
			eruptions, and these...

	Riker points to the other map.

					RIKER
				(continuing)
			... are the phaser drilling sites.

	Riker presses a button and the two drawings overlap.
	The points are nearly identical. Picard looks up at
	Riker. Both men are aware of what has happened.

					PICARD
			The mantle is collapsing where
			the pressure was released.

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT THREE  35.

35   CONTINUED: (2)

					GEORDI
			Captain, Doctor Moseley and I have
			a couple of ideas, but they're
			going to take some time to sort
			out.

					PICARD
			Sort them out, Commander.

					GEORDI
			Aye, sir.

	The view of the lab is replaced by the shrouded planet
	with multiple volcanic plumes now visible. Lightning
	can be seen at the cloud tops.

					RIKER
				(looking at the screen)
			We came here to help these people.

					PICARD
			And look what we've done.

	Off Picard's reaction we:

									CUT TO:

36   EXT SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit.

37   INT. CORRIDOR

	Rasmussen walks by some crewmen and cheerfully nods.
	He goes to Data's door, rings the bell. The door opens
	and a bizarre cacophony of sounds almost overpowers
	him.

38   INT. DATA'S QUARTERS (OPTICAL)

	Data is busy at his console.

					RASMUSSEN
				(shouting)
			What in God's name is that?!

					DATA
				(shouting)
			Music, Professor.

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/26/91 - ACT THREE  36.

38   CONTINUED:

					RASMUSSEN
				(shouting)
			Music?

					DATA
				(shouting)
			Yes, sir. Mozart's "Jupiter
			symphony in G minor"; Bach's "Third
			Brandenberg Concerto"; Beethoven's
			"Symphony Number Nine, Second
			Movement 'Molto Vivace'"; and "La
			Donna e Mobile", from Verdi's
			"Rigoletto".

					RASMUSSEN
				(shouting)
			Could you thin it out a bit?

					DATA
			Computer, eliminate Program One.

	One of the four compositions is silenced. Rasmussen
	shakes his head.

					DATA
			Computer, eliminate Program Two.

	Another program stops. Rasmussen shakes his head
	again.

					DATA
			Computer, eliminate Program Three.

	Only one is still playing. Rasmussen uses his finger
	to suggest Data turn it down.

					DATA
			Computer, half volume.

	The sound gets quieter and Rasmussen nods approval.

					RASMUSSEN
			How the hell can you listen to
			four pieces of music at the same
			time?

					DATA
			Actually, I am capable of
			distinguishing over one hundred
			fifty simultaneous compositions.

					DATA
			I am assisting Commander La Forge
			in the analysis of an extremely

					RASMUSSEN
			I came to thank you for answering

			should have asked you to limit
			yourself to fifty thousand words.

					DATA
			You did ask me to be thorough.

					RASMUSSEN
			I realize it's hard to believe,
			Data, but very few records of
			Doctor Soong's work survived to
			the twenty-sixth century. It
			would be invaluable to myself and
			other historians if you could
			provide us with some schematics.

					DATA
			Certainly, as soon as my work here
			is completed.

					RASMUSSEN
			Just as long as it's before

			Yes, Worf.

			Commander La Forge is hailing you

			Patch it through, please.

38   CONTINUED: (3)

	Geordi appears on Data's MONITOR. As soon as Data
	turns, Rasmussen takes a tricorder from the desk and,
	almost inadvertantly, pockets it.

					GEORDI
			Have you rerun the phase reversal
			figures, Data?

					DATA
			There were no errors, Geordi.
			The variance must be no more than
			point zero six terawatts.

					GEORDI
			I don't see any other choice.
			We'll keep running the numbers
			down here. You better inform the
			captain... of the good news and

				(amused)
			Which do you suppose he's going
			to want to hear first?

	Off Data's reaction we CUT TO:

39   INT. READY ROOM

	We open on CU of Picard. Data is there.

					PICARD
			The good news.

					DATA
			The motion of the dust has created
			a great deal of electrostatic
			energy in the upper atmosphere.
			With a modified phaser blast, we
			could create a shock-front that
			would encircle the planet and
			ionize the particles.

					PICARD
			That would be like striking a
			spark in a room filled with gas.

    STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - 9/20/91 - ACT THREE    39.

39   CONTINUED:

					DATA
			With one exception, sir. The
			particles would be converted
			into a high-energy plasma which
			our shields could absorb and
			redirect harmlessly into space.

					PICARD
			Turn the Enterprise into a
			lightning rod.

					DATA
			Precisely, sir.

					PICARD
			And what about the bad news, Data?

					DATA
			If our phaser discharge is off
			by as little as point-zero-six
			terawatts, it would cause a
			cascading exothermal inversion.

					PICARD
			Meaning?

					DATA
			We would completely burn off the
			planet's atmosphere.

	Off Picard's reaction we:

42   INT. READY ROOM

	Picard is staring out the window deep in thought. The

					PICARD
				(not turning)
			Come.

	Rasmussen ENTERS. Picard continues to stare out the
	window.

					PICARD
			I would imagine you know why I've
			asked you here.

					RASMUSSEN
			I have a fairly good idea.

					PICARD
			I'm faced with a dilemma. There's
			a planet beneath us that is slowly
			turning to ice. If we don't do
			something about it, I'm told that
			within weeks, thousands, perhaps
			tens of thousands, will die.

					RASMUSSEN
			That would be a shame.

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT FOUR  41.

42   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(turning to Rasmussen)
			Yes, it would. It would be quite
			a shame.

					RASMUSSEN
			So what's your dilemma?

					PICARD
			Mister La Forge has a possible
			solution. The margin of error
			is extremely critical, but if it's
			successful, there's no more
			threat.

					RASMUSSEN
			And if it's not successful?

					PICARD
			Every living thing on the planet
			will perish.

					RASMUSSEN
			So... do nothing and thousands
			will die. Do something and
			millions could die. Tough choice.

					PICARD
				(speaking hypothetically
				 -- he's not asking)
			Not if you were to help me.

					RASMUSSEN
			You're not suggesting I tell you
			the outcome of your efforts?

					PICARD
			No, I'm not. Everything Starfleet
			stands for, everything I've ever
			believed in, tells me I can't
			ask you that.
				(pause)
			But at the same time, there are
			twenty million lives down there,
			and you know what happened to
			them... what will happen to them.

					RASMUSSEN
			So, it seems you have another
			dilemma. One that questions your
			convictions.

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT FOUR  42.

42   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
			I have never been afraid to
			reevaluate my convictions,
			Professor. Right now, I have
			twenty million reasons to do so.

					RASMUSSEN
			And why did you ask to see me?

					PICARD
			Your presence potentially gives
			me access to a kind of information
			that was never available to me
			before. An additional tool, a
			new weapon in my armory... you,
			Professor. If I'm going to
			reexamine my beliefs, I must
			take advantage of every possible
			asset. It would be irresponsible
			of me not to have you here.

					RASMUSSEN
			However you come to terms with
			your beliefs, Captain, I must
			tell you I'm quite comfortable 
			with mine.

					PICARD
			How can you be? How can you be
			"comfortable" watching people die?

					RASMUSSEN
				(patronizing)
			Let me put it this way. If I were
			to tell you that none of those
			people died, you'd easily conclude
			that you tried your "solution"
			and it succeeded. So, you'd
			confidently try again. No harm
			in that. But what if I were to
			tell you they all died? What
			then? Obviously, you'd decide not
			to make the same mistake twice.
			Now, what if one of those...

					PICARD
				(interrupting)
			I know, Professor, "What if one
			of those lives I save down there
			is a child who grows up to be the
			next Adolf Hitler or Khan Singh?"

42   CONTINUED: (3)

					PICARD (cont'd)
			First year philosophy students
			have been asked that question ever
			since the earliest wormholes were
			discovered. But this is not a
			class in temporal logic... It's
			not hypothetical, it's real.
			Can't you see that?

					RASMUSSEN
			I see it all too well. But you
			must see that if I were to
			influence you, everything in this
			sector, in this quadrant of the
			galaxy could change. History, my
			history, would unfold in a way
			other than it already has. Now
			what possible incentive could
			anyone offer me to allow that to
			happen?

					PICARD
			I have two choices. Either way,
			one version or another of history
			will wend its way forward. The
			history you know or another one.
			Who's to say which is better?
			All I know here, today, is that
			one way, millions of lives could
			be saved. Isn't that incentive
			enough?

					RASMUSSEN
			Everyone dies, Captain. It's just
			a question of when. All of those
			people down there died years
			before I was born. All of you
			up here, as well. So you see,
			I can't get quite as worked up
			as you over the fate of some
			colonists who, for me, have been
			dead a long time.

					PICARD
			We have a Prime Directive,
			Professor, which tells us we have
			no right to interfere with the
			natural evolution of alien worlds.
					(MORE)

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT FOUR  44.

42   CONTINUED: (4)

					PICARD (cont'd)
			But even though I am sworn to
			uphold it, I have disregarded that
			directive on more than one
			occasion... When I knew it was
			the right thing to do. If you
			are holding true to some
			"temporal" equivalent of that
			directive, isn't there a
			possibility that this is an
			occasion for you to make an
			exception, to help me choose...
			because it's the right thing to
			do?

					RASMUSSEN
			Are we just talking about a
			choice? It sounds to me like
			you're trying to manipulate the
			future.

					PICARD
			Every choice we make allows us
			to manipulate the future. Do I
			ask Marie or Suzanne to the spring
			dance? Do I take my holiday on
			Tahiti or on Risa? A man's life,
			his future, hinges on each of a
			thousand choices. Living is
			making choices.

42   CONTINUED: (5)

					PICARD (cont'd)
			Now you ask me to believe that
			if I make a choice other than the
			one found in your history books,
			it could irreparably alter your
			past! Well, perhaps I don't give
			a damn about your past, Professor
			Rasmussen. Because your past is
			my future and as far as I'm
			concerned, it hasn't been written
			yet.

					RIKER'S COM VOICE
			Captain, the electrostatic
			conditions are about as good as
			they're going to get. If we're
			going to try this, now's the time.

	Picard turns to Rasmussen. A beat.

	For a brief instant Rasmussen's guard drops. His
	cockiness now has a trace of remorse.

					RASMUSSEN
			Please don't ask me, Captain.
			I can't help you. I'm sorry.

	After a long stare, Picard almost seems to smile. He
	turns and EXITS. Rasmussen innocently returns the
	smile and follows Picard onto the bridge. On his way
	out, Rasmussen takes a small pile of isolinear chips
	from a table. They disappear into his pocket.

43   INT. MAIN BRIDGE

	Picard ENTERS with Rasmussen following. Riker, Data,

					PICARD
				(to Riker)
			How long will it take them to

					RIKER
				(seeing Picard means

			We just need to tie in Geordi's

  STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/30/91 - ACT FOUR  45A.

43   CONTINUED:

					RASMUSSEN
			So you've made your choice after
			all... and without my help.

					PICARD
			Quite the contrary, Professor.
			You've been quite helpful.

					RASMUSSEN
			How's that?

					PICARD
			By your refusing to assist me,
			I'm left with the same choice I
			began with; to try or not to
			try... to run the risk or to play
			it safe. But your arguments have
			reminded me how precious the right
			to choose can be... that right
			or wrong, the choice is mine.
			And since I've never been much
			for playing it safe... I choose

	The last reminders of the huge vibrations and noise
	echo into silence. All is still.

59   ANGLE ON VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	the now cloudless planet is visible. A few smaller
	volcanic plumes can be seen.

60   RESUME

	Picard looks to Riker and then to Data.

					PICARD
				(tentatively)
			Mister La Forge?

	A beat.

61   BACK TO VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)

	as it switches to the science lab, where there's a
	guarded optimism reflected in all the faces. The snow
	has stopped.

					GEORDI
			La Forge here. Still breathing,
			Captain.

					MOSELEY
			Particulate levels are right where
			they're supposed to be... and the
			sun is shining!

					GEORDI
			You see, sir, I told you there
			was nothing to worry about.

					PICARD
			Report back to the ship when
			you're ready, Commander.
				(to Moseley)
			Doctor, we'll stay in orbit to
			analyze the remaining volcanic
			disturbances.
				(smiling)
			I think the best advice might be
			to let them cool down on their
			own.

					MOSELEY
			I'm getting in the habit of
			thanking you, Picard.

	Moseley touches a button and the screen returns to
	the view of the cloudless planet.

	Rasmussen stands and approaches Picard.

					RASMUSSEN
			Well, I'd love to see more, but
			it's nearly time for me to go.
			I'm tickled pink to have had the
			opportunity of witnessing this,
			Picard.
				(patronizing)
			And you did it all without any
			help.

	Rasmussen opens a ring on one of his fingers and looks
	inside.

					RASMUSSEN
				(continuing)
			I must run. I've got some packing
			to do.
				(as he passes Riker)
			You know, you're taller in person.

	As Rasmussen EXITS, Picard turns to Worf and nods.

64   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - OPTICAL

	in orbit around the planet.

65   INT. SHUTTLEBAY (OPTICAL)

	Rasmussen, his valise over a shoulder, ENTERS to find
	Picard, Beverly, Riker, Worf, and Data by his vessel.
	An N.D. SECURITY GUARD stands nearby.

					RASMUSSEN
			Would you look at this. Who would
			have suspected a teary farewell?

					PICARD
			I'm afraid we're going to have
			to take a look in your vessel,
			Professor.

					RASMUSSEN
				(they just don't get
				 it)
			Curious till the end, eh, Captain?

	Picard remains stern-faced.

					RASMUSSEN
				(continuing)
			You can't be serious, Picard.
			We've been through this more than
			once and I...

					PICARD
			A number of objects have turned
			up missing in the last few days.
			If they are in your possession,
			I would like them returned.

					RASMUSSEN
			I'm not here in search of relics.

	Rasmussen opens his ring again, looks in and starts
	toward his ship.

					RASMUSSEN
				(continuing)
			I'm sure they'll turn up.

	Worf blocks his way.

       STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT FIVE      53.

65   CONTINUED:

					WORF
			If you will not open the vessel,
			I will... with explosives, if
			necessary.

					RASMUSSEN
				(defiant)
			I doubt you have the means.

					RIKER
			If we don't get in that thing,
			I guarantee you won't either.

	Rasmussen shows the first signs of panic. But it
	vanishes and he smiles.

					RASMUSSEN
				(to Picard)
			Considering the sensitive nature
			of my equipment, I think you'll
			understand if I request that only
			Mister Data be allowed to see it.

					RIKER
			Why Data?

					PICARD
				(understanding)
			Because if I order Data never to
			divulge what he sees in there,
			he won't.
				(to Data)
			With the exception of anything
			that might belong to us.

					DATA
			Understood, sir.

	Rasmussen smiles and leads Data toward the craft.

					RASMUSSEN
			Back in a minute.

	Rasmussen presses the back of his hand and then his
	palm against a specific point on the vessel and a door
	APPEARS and OPENS. He enters followed by Data, who
	glances back at Picard a beat before the door REAPPEARS
	and CLOSES. Worf, Beverly, Picard and Riker look at
	each other.

         STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - 9/20/91 - ACT FIVE         54.

66   INT. VESSEL

	The vessel's interior, similar to its exterior, is
	truly futuristic, with multifaceted panels containing
	minimal blinkies. As Data ENTERS, he immediately
	notices two large collector trays.

	Normally slid into a rack, the trays are exposed and
	filled with objects stolen from the Enterprise: two
	tricorders, a neural stimulator, a hypospray and
	bioscanner, one of Geordi's visors, PADDS, a small desk
	top viewer, a Klingon knife, piles of isolinear chips
	and other computer chips, palm beacons, even bar
	glasses and silverware from Ten Forward, and various
	other whatsits from here and there. Data examines the
	loot and turns to Rasmussen.

					DATA
			I do not believe any of these
			items belong to you, Professor.

	Rasmussen raises a phaser at Data.

					RASMUSSEN
			Nor does this!

	Data stands very still.

					RASMUSSEN
				(continuing)
			This phaser is set at the highest
			stun setting. If I'm correct,
			that is sufficient to immobilize
			even you.

					DATA
			Do you plan to put these objects
			into a museum?

					RASMUSSEN
			They're far too valuable for that.
			You see, in the century I come
			from, they haven't even been
			invented yet.

	Data looks at the ship's futuristic design.

					DATA
			But this vessel... ? And the
			temporal distortion that coincided
			with your arrival?

       STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT FIVE      55.

66   CONTINUED:

					RASMUSSEN
			Oh, this is a time-pod. And it
			is from the twenty-sixth
			century... at least that's what
			the poor fellow said. You see,
			he decided to travel back to the
			twenty-second century... that's
			my time, and he had the misfortune
			of meeting me... His clothes
			fit quite well, don't you think?
				(gesturing to the pod)
			Took me weeks to figure out how
			to work this thing.

					DATA
			You are not an historian?

					RASMUSSEN
			More of an inventor. Up till a
			few weeks ago, a dismally
			unsuccessful one.

					DATA
			What are your intentions, now?

					RASMUSSEN
			Well, thanks to your captain, it
			seems my intentions have changed
			slightly.

	He points to the trays.

					RASMUSSEN
				(continuing)
			I was quite content with the
			notion of returning with those
			trinkets. I'd "invent" about one
			a year. But now, look what
			fortune has graced me with...
				(pointing toward Data)
			You will take a little longer to
			figure out than a tricorder, but
			it should be well worth the
			effort.

	He checks his ring.

					RASMUSSEN
				(continuing)
			If the auto-timer is programmed
			the way I think it is...
					(MORE)

66   CONTINUED: (2)

					RASMUSSEN (cont'd)
			in about two minutes we'll be on
			our way back to a place called
			New Jersey... I'm afraid you
			won't be awake for the ride.

	Rasmussen aims the phaser at Data and tries to fire,
	but it only makes a lame noise. Panicked, he readjusts
	and fires again... nothing.

					DATA
			I assume your hand print will open
			the door whether you are conscious
			or not.

	Off Rasmussen's look, we CUT TO:

67   INT. SHUTTLEBAY - (OPTICAL)

	Picard, Beverly, Riker, Worf, and an N.D. Security
	guard, as before. The vessel door opens and Rasmussen
	exits, closely followed by Data, who now carries the
	phaser.

					RASMUSSEN
				(disgusted)
			That weapon was working yesterday.

					DATA
				(to Picard, handing him
				 the phaser)
			You were correct to suspect him,
			sir. But he is from the past,
			not the future.

	Picard reacts to what Data says and turns to Rasmussen.

					PICARD
				(mimicking Rasmussen
				 in Act Four)
			Trying to make my history unfold
			in a way other than it already
			has, Professor?

					RASMUSSEN
			This was all a misunderstanding,
			Picard. Just let me back in there
			and we'll forget the whole thing.

         STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - 9/20/91 - ACT FIVE         57.

67   CONTINUED:

					PICARD
				(still mimicking)
			Now what possible incentive could
			anyone offer me to allow that?

					DATA
				(to Riker)
			I believe you will find all the
			missing items in the vessel, sir.

	Riker nods to Worf who acknowledges and heads into the
	vessel. Rasmussen turns to Beverly with a desperate,
	pleading look.

					RASMUSSEN
			Doctor...

					BEVERLY
				(ice)
			A very nice performance.

					RASMUSSEN
				(a touch of remorse)
			Not all of it. Some of it was
			real.

	Beverly's cold stare tells him he's wasting his time.
	He checks his ring and turns toward Picard, panicky.

					RASMUSSEN
			Captain...

					DATA
			He claims to be a twenty-second
			century inventor, sir.

					PICARD
				(it's all coming into
				 focus)
			Well, it's too bad you weren't
			a bit more inventive. If fewer
			things had disappeared, we might
			not have suspected you. As it
			was, our only stumbling block was
			your vessel. Our sensors couldn't
			penetrate it.

	Worf climbs out of the pod carrying the two trays.

       STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - REV. 9/25/91 - ACT FIVE      58.

67   CONTINUED: (2)

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			But as soon as the door opened,
			our computer was able to detect
			and deactivate everything you'd
			stolen...
				(holding up the phaser)
			... including this.

	Picard drops it onto the top tray as Worf passes him.
	Worf hands the trays to the N.D. security guard.

					RASMUSSEN
			I'd love to hear more, Picard,
			but I really must get back in that
			pod.

	Rasmussen heads for the vessel, but is stopped by Worf.
	Picard looks to Riker.

					RIKER
			Take him to a detention cell,
			Mister Worf. And notify Starfleet
			that we'll be dropping him off
			at Starbase Two-one-four.

					RASMUSSEN
				(panicking, struggling)
			You can't do this... I've got
			to get back... I don't belong
			here.

	The tiny ship suddenly GLOWS, SHIMMERS, and DISAPPEARS.
	Rasmussen can't believe it.

					RASMUSSEN
			No!

	Worf walks him toward the exit.

					PICARD
			I'm sure there are more than a
			few legitimate historians at
			Starfleet who will be quite eager
			to meet a Human from your era.

	Worf and Rasmussen reach the exit.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Oh, and Professor...

         STAR TREK: "A Matter of Time" - 9/20/91 - ACT FIVE         59.

67   CONTINUED: (3)

	Rasmussen stops and turns.

					PICARD
				(continuing)
			Welcome to the twenty-fourth
			century.

	Worf and Rasmussen EXIT. Off reactions, we CUT TO:

68   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (OPTICAL)

	in orbit of Penthara IV.

									FADE OUT.
